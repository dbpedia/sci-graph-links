Res. Lett. 27, 1431). The study of the magnetic connectivity associated with coronal dimming can shed new light on the magnetic nature of CMEs. In this study, four major flare-CME events on 14 July 2000, 28 October 2003, 7 November 2004, and 15 January 2005 are analyzed. They were all halo CMEs associated with major flare activity in complex active regions (ARs) and produced severe space weather consequences. To explore the magnetic connectivity of these CMEs, global potential-field extrapolations based on the composite synoptic magnetograms from the Michelson Doppler Imager onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory are constructed, and their association with coronal dimming is revealed by the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope. It is found that each flare-CME event involved interaction of more than ten sets of magnetic-loop systems. These loop systems occupied over 50% of all identified loop systems in the visible hemisphere and covered a wide range of solar longitudes and latitudes. We categorize the loop systems as active-region loops (ARLs), AR-interconnecting loops (ARILs) including transequatorial loops (TLs), and long arcades (LAs) straddling filament channels. A recurring pattern, the saddle-field configuration (SFC), consisting of ARILs, is found to be present in all four major flare-CME events. The magnetic connectivity revealed by this work implies that intercoupling and interaction of multiple flux-loop systems are required for a major CME. For comparison, a simple flare-CME event of 12 May 1997 with a relatively simple magnetic configuration is chosen. Even for this simple flare-CME event, we find that multiple flux-loop systems are also present." .

The data reveal a motion field in which wave activity occurs over a range of frequencies and in episodes generally lasting for less than two months. A seasonal cycle is apparent in which the largest observed amplitudes are as high as 14 ms−1 and are observed from January to mid-April. A minimum in activity occurs in late June to early July. A second, smaller, maximum follows in late summer/autumn where amplitudes reach up to 7–10 ms−1. Considerable interannual variability is apparent but wave activity is observed in the summers of all the years examined, albeit at very small amplitudes near mid summer. This behaviour suggests that the equatorial winds in the mesopause region do not completely prevent inter-hemispheric ducting of the wave from the winter hemisphere, or that it is generated in situ." .

Acetylcholinesterase cytochemistry was used in the demonstration of the greater density of synapses over the caudal papillae. The various techniques contributed to a better understanding of the distribution and form of papillae and synapses at the posterior face of the electrocyte. Caudal papillae are longer and thinner than those at the rostral face, but it was not possible to recognize a different type sometimes referred to in the literature as small papillae. The contact of nerve endings with the electrocyte seems to be made predominantly on the terminal half of caudal papillae, however a smaller number occur elsewhere on the posterior face. Synaptic terminals frequently appear as round profiles, but may be also elongated, with or without bulges, usually occupying a depression, and separated from the post-synaptic membrane by a space of 60–100 nm, where an expansion may be found." .

The corona is characterised by mostly closed magnetic structures and short-lived, small coronal holes. The axis of the Sun's dipole field is close to the solar equator; there are also important contributions from the higher order terms. This complex and variable coronal magnetic configuration leads to a much increased variability in the HMF on all time scales, at all latitudes. The transition from solar minimum to solar maximum conditions, as reflected in the HMF, is described, as observed by Ulysses during its passage to high southern heliolatitudes. The magnetic signatures associated with the interaction regions generated by short-lived fast solar wind streams are presented, together with the highly disordered period in mid-1999 when there was a considerable reorganisation in coronal structures. The magnetic sector structure at high heliolatitudes shows, from mid-1999, a recognisable two-sector structure, corresponding to a highly inclined Heliospheric Current Sheet. A preliminary investigation of the radial component of the magnetic field indicates that it remains, on average, constant as a function of heliolatitude. Intervals of highly Alfvénic fluctuations in the rarefaction regions trailing the interaction regions have been, even if intermittently, identified even close to solar maximum." .

A dual-level procedure has been adopted for studying the kinetics of the reaction. Geometrical optimization and frequency calculation were performed at DFT(BHandHLYP)/6-311G(d,p) while single-point energy calculation was made at CCSD(T)/6-311G(d,p) level of theory. The intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculation has also been performed to confirm the smooth transition from the reactant to product through the respective transition state. The rate constants were calculated using conventional transition state theory (TST). It has been found that 99 % of the reaction proceeded via the H-atom abstraction from the –CH2F end of the sevoflurane. The rate constant of the dominant path is found to be 1.13 × 10−13 cm3 molecule−1 s−1. This is in excellent agreement with the reported experimental rate constant of 1.10 × 10−13 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 obtained by relative rate method using FTIR/Smog chamber and LP/LIF techniques." .

No clear evidence was found in support of the premise that these nucleolar particles represent segments of the threads with which they are associated.10.In sections of root tips which had been RNased between fixation and dehydration, the 150 Å peripheral particles and 50 Å duplex loop elements were not seen. It was not certain whether some other major elements were affected." .

The study includes the transition regime and non-usual cross-sectional shapes. The structure of the vortices is examined by means of precise visualizations both in the mid-cross and mid-span planes. The particulars induced by the hollow face are deduced from a comparison with the cases of analogous solid cylinders and more particularly with the full semicircular cylinder (Boisaubert et al., 1996; Coutanceau et al., 1998). The crosswise analysis shows that, except some fundamental difference at the separation initiation and some differences in details, a similar development of the Bénard-Kàrmàn-vortices is observed, thus :- the regime of the occurring structures changes beyond the first phase of development (i.e.t * ≥ 6) when Reynolds number is passing through a critical valueRe c (here 120 ≤Re c ≤ 140)- Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities are detected forRe = 600 in the rolled-up separated shear layers originating from the sharp body-edges. On the contrary, the spanwise analysis reveals that the hollow face plays an important role in the time-development of the induced body-end three-dimensionalities (end-vortices and opposite spanwise currents) and intrinsic three-dimensionalities respectively. Thus, as opposed to solid bodies similarly limited in span, the emergence of clear patterns of secondary Taylor-Görtler-like vortices in the near wake have been experimentally proved for the first time whenRe passes beyond the transition value ofRe t ≊ 200. The consequence on the global structure of the flow is deduced." .

The diheme enzyme MauG catalyzes O-atom insertion and cross-linking of two Trp residues to complete TTQ synthesis. Solution optical and Mössbauer spectroscopic studies have indicated that the reactive form of MauG during turnover is an unusual bisFe(IV) intermediate, which has been formulated as a His-ligated ferryl heme [Fe(IV)=O] (heme A), and an Fe(IV) heme with an atypical His/Tyr ligation (heme B). In this study, Fe K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure studies have been combined with density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT methods to solve the geometric and electronic structures of each heme site in the MauG bisFe(IV) redox state. The ferryl heme site (heme A) is compared with the well-characterized compound I intermediate of cytochrome c peroxidase. Heme B is unprecedented in biology, and is shown to have a six-coordinate, S = 1 environment, with a short (1.85-Å) Fe–O(Tyr) bond. Experimentally calibrated DFT calculations are used to reveal a strong covalent interaction between the Fe and the O(Tyr) ligand of heme B in the high-valence form. A large change in the Fe–O(Tyr) bond distance on going from Fe(II) (2.02 Å) to Fe(III) (1.89 Å) to Fe(IV) (1.85 Å) signifies increasing localization of spin density on the tyrosinate ligand upon sequential oxidation of heme B to Fe(IV). As such, O(Tyr) plays an active role in attaining and stabilizing the MauG bisFe(IV) redox state." .

The algorithm allows selected pixels to be excluded from the source-finding, thus excluding saturated pixels (from flares and/or active regions). For Chandra data the noise is determined by photon-counting statistics, whereas solar telescopes typically integrate a flux. Thus, the calculated signal-to-noise ratio is incorrect, but we find that we can scale the number to get reasonable results. We compare our source-finding to previous Yohkoh results and find a similar number of bright points. Finally, we analyze three sets of data from Hinode, representing different parts of the decline to minimum of the solar cycle. Although these preliminary results are based on a small sample, we see no dependence on the solar cycle." .

Such a criterion is based on two facts to be observed in the study of intermittent discharges with a low-pressure gas: 1) it is possible to note a rise time of the oscillation pulse at the beginning of the first kind which is independent of the external circuit. 2) in these conditions a notable overtension exists at the start of the intermittent discharges in respect to the initial tension of Townsend’s phase. From an evaluation of the pulse rise time and overtension value a calculation of the formative time of the cathodic space charge is possible. At the end, moreover, a general picture of the different kinds of intermittent discharges and conditions of their existence is drawn." .

The observed phenomena that occurred during the Tromsø heating experiment in the nightside auroral Es region of the ionosphere depend on the phase of substorm. The heating excited small-scale field-aligned irregularities in the E region responsible for field-aligned scattering of diagnostic HF waves. The equipment used in the experiment was sensitive to electron density irregularities with wavelengths 12–15 m across the geomagnetic field lines. Analysis of the Doppler measurement data shows the appearance of quasiperiodic variations with a Doppler frequency shift, f d and periods about 100–120 s during the heating cycle coinciding in time with the first substorm activation and initiation of the upward field-aligned currents. A relationship between wave variations in f d and magnetic pulsations in the Y-component of the geomagnetic field at Tromsø was detected. The analysis of the magnetic field variations from the IMAGE magnetometer stations shows that ULF waves occurred, not only at Tromsø, but in the adjacent area bounded by geographical latitudes from 70.5° to 68° and longitudes from 16° to 27°. It is suggested that the ULF observed can result from superposition of the natural and heater-induced ULF waves. During the substorm expansion a strong stimulated electromagnetic emission (SEE) at the third harmonic of the downshifted maximum frequency was found. It is believed that SEE is accompanied by excitation of the VLF waves penetrating into magneto-sphere and stimulating the precipitation of the energetic electrons (10–40 keV) of about 1-min duration. This is due to a cyclotron resonant interaction of natural precipitating electrons (1–10 keV) with heater-induced whistler waves in the magnetosphere. It is reasonable to suppose that a new substorm activation, exactly above Tromsø, was closely connected with the heater-induced precipitation of energetic electrons." .

The times of the quantum image cycle shift operations are controlled by a hyper-chaotic sequence generated by a new 4D hyper-chaotic system. The image pixels are scrambled by the iterative generalized Arnold transform, and the values of the pixels are altered by the quantum image cycle shift operations. The four initial conditions of the new 4D hyper-chaotic system are exploited to control the two parameters, the iterative rounds of the generalized Arnold transform and the times of the quantum image cycle shift operations, respectively.

The wave propagation in a cylindrical metallic waveguide including a dielectric tube is investigated. Two electron beams with opposite velocities are injected in the system as energy sources. It is shown that one of the electron beams is responsible for Cherenkov radiation, the other one is as the stabilizer. The dispersion relation of the waves, impedance of the waves, operating frequency of the system and time growth rate of THz waves are investigated. The effects of relative permittivity constant of dielectric tube, the geometrical dimensions, and the accelerating voltage on time growth rate are investigated. The effective factors on the frequency spectra of the waveguide will be presented too. It is obtained that the time growth rate of the waves increases with increasing the dielectric permittivity and thickness of the dielectric tube. In addition, with increasing the accelerating voltage the time growth rate has opposite behavior in some of the branches of the dispersion graphs. The power obtained in the excitation process for one branch of the dispersion graphs is presented. The graph of variations of transported power with respect to the wave frequency is plotted." .

The mass change caused by the selective adsorption of selenite ions on the cadmium selenite crystals at the solid/solution interface was detected by the QCM. The response (−ΔF) of the modified QCM oscillator increased with increasing selenite ion concentrations in sample solutions, ranging from 9.7×10−5 to 9.0×10−4 M at pH 7.4. The synthetic process of anchoring cadmium selenite crystals on the phosphorylated MUD organic film was also followed by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The atomic concentrations measured by XPS confirmed the crystal growth of cadmium selenite on the phosphorylated MUD SAM at the QCM gold electrode surface. From the AFM images, changes in surface topographic features were followed: the MUD SAM and phosphorylated MUD on the QCM gold electrode had similar surface roughness; however the difference for the cadmium selenite film on the phosphorylated MUD SAM was clearly seen. The observed QCM frequency change of the modified QCM oscillator per unit time was found to be proportional to the square of the supersaturation of cadmium selenite, indicating the crystal growth of cadmium selenite at the solid/solution interface. The modified QCM oscillator exhibited selectively strong QCM response to SeO3 2− ion. In contrast, the responses to tested interfering anions were almost negligible. The order of anion selectivities of the present modified QCM sensor was SeO3 2−≫CO3 2−>SeO2− 4, SO4 2−, Br−, I−, NO3 −. These selectivities were basically attributable to the differences in solubility products and solubilities for the salts of each anion with cadmium (II) ion." .

We then use three-dimensional MHD numerical simulations to compute the propagation of wave packets through self-similar magnetohydrostatic sunspot models. The simulations are set up in such a way as to allow a comparison with observed cross-covariances (except in the immediate vicinity of the sunspot). We find that the simulation and the f-mode observations are in good agreement when the model sunspot has a peak field strength of 3 kG at the photosphere and less so for lower field strengths. Constraining the sunspot model with helioseismology is only possible because the direct effect of the magnetic field on the waves has been fully taken into account. Our work shows that the full-waveform modeling of sunspots is feasible." .

An advantage of the new method is that it enables us to detect and investigate stresses in bodies which are opaque to visible light but permeable to ultra-high-frequency radio waves (porcelain, radioceramics, abrasives, ferrites, rubber, etc.). In addition it is comparatively easy to find the numerical values of the principal stresses by this method. Polarization methods reveal the stressed state of a solid as a collection of bands (lines equal in value to the difference between the principal stresses) or as isoclines from which isostats (lines of principal stress) are constructed. The first radiopolariscope described in [1] involved a great amount of work in plotting the bands (isochromes), and the accuracy of the results was not high." .

In the present method, the description of the cluster wave function is extended from (0s) harmonic-oscillator shell model to a few-body model with a realistic interaction, in which the wave functions of the subsystems are determined with the Stochastic Variational Method. In order to calculate the matrix elements of the four-body system, we have developed a Triple Global Vector Representation method for the correlated Gaussian basis functions. To compare effects of the cluster distortion with realistic and effective interactions, we employ the AV8′ potential + a three nucleon force as a realistic interaction and the Minnesota potential as an effective interaction. Especially for 1 S 0, the calculated phase shifts show that the t+p and h+n channels are strongly coupled to the d+d channel for the case of the realistic interaction. On the contrary, the coupling of these channels plays a relatively minor role for the case of the effective interaction. This difference between both potentials originates from the tensor term in the realistic interaction. Furthermore, the tensor interaction makes the energy splitting of the negative parity states of 4He consistent with experiments. No such splitting is however reproduced with the effective interaction." .

During the 2006 appearance, two of them (B and C) showed very strong coma activity. Our R-filter imaging of 73P-B & C from 21 January to 25 May 2006 revealed the presence of fan-like structures in the comae of both components and evidence for further fragmentation events in component B. As of early April 2006, component C showed two jets emanating from the nucleus, with one continuously visible. Through a simulation of the orbital geometry we infer that the rotation axis of 73P-C has an inclination of 20° to the orbital plane and a longitude of 45° at perihelion. The coma activity of component B was highly variable, displaying signatures of at least 3 fragmentation events. The coma was characterized by the continuous presence of a jet roughly in sunward direction, starting from the beginning of May. The first fragmentation event of component B may have happened between April 16 and April 26, leading to the presence of at least 6 fragments detected in images of May 2. The second one happened on or shortly before May 8, the third one between May 18 and 24. For the rotation axis of 73P-B we infer an inclination of 5°–15° to the orbital plane and a longitude of 20°–30° at perihelion." .

In this work SU-8 was examined with regards to its suitability to be used for high-resolution MOEMS. This is done exemplarily for a LIGA microspectrometer as this device can be thoroughly analyzed evaluating the side wall quality and the optical gratings as single structures, as well as the whole optical system [2]. In order to eliminate the high damping of visible light inside solid SU-8 material, a hollow wave guide design has been chosen. SU-8 was detected to reproduce structures in the nanometer-regime, combined with an averaged peak-to-valley profile better than PMMA. Although the measured roughness of SU-8 is worse than that of PMMA, there is still a comparable damping of the signal in MOEMS for both resists." .

(Phys. Rep. 300:215–347, 1998). Our starting points are the physical processes in which such form factors are measured, i.e. electron scattering off the bound state, or the semileptonic weak decay of the bound state. These processes are treated by means of a coupled-channel framework for a Bakamjian–Thomas type mass operator. A current with the correct covariance properties is then derived from the pertinent leading-order electroweak scattering or decay amplitude. As it turns out, the electromagnetic current is affected by unphysical contributions which can be traced back to wrong cluster properties inherent in the Bakamjian–Thomas construction. These spurious contributions, however, can be separated uniquely, as in the covariant light-front approach. In this way we end up with form factors which agree with those obtained from the covariant light-front approach. As an example we will present results for electroweak form factors of heavy–light systems and discuss the heavy-quark limit which leads to the famous Isgur–Wise function." .

We assume the quadratic inhomogeneity in rigidity and density in the lower half-space and irregularity is taken in the form of rectangle at the interface separating the layer from the lower half-space. The dispersion equation for torsional waves has been obtained in a closed form. Velocity equation is also obtained in the absence of irregularity. The study reveals that the presence of irregularity, initial stress, porosity, inhomogeneity and anisotropy factor in the dispersion equation approves the significant effect of these parameters in the propagation of torsional waves in porous medium. It has also been observed that for a uniform media, the velocity equation reduces to the classical result of Love wave." .

These sublines differ in radiation sensitivity: LY-R is more resistant (D 0 = 1.1 Gy) and LY-S more sensitive (D 0 = 0.5 Gy). Halo diameters were measured after cell lysis in the presence of propidium iodide (PI)(0.5 to 50 µg/ml) at pH 6.9 or 9. The maximal DNA unwinding in PI was obtained at 7.5 µg/ml PI, at both pH 6.9 and 9 in both sublines; the maximal halo diameter was larger in LY-S than in LY-R cells. In nucleoids from both sublines DNA could be rewound at higher (10–50 µ/ml) PI concentrations both at pH 6.9 and 9. This ability was impaired by mercaptoethanol or DDTC(Na) (at pH 9) or by X-irradiation, indicating damage and/or alteration in the DNA superhelical structure. The susceptibility to reducing/chelating agents was greater in LY-S than in LY-R nucleoids, pointing to differences in chromatin structure between these sublines. The amount of X-ray-inflicted damage was higher, when measured at pH 9 than at pH 6.9 and was about twice larger in LY-S than in LY-R nucleoids, when the cells were irradiated with the same X-ray dose. From analogies between the behaviour of nucleoids under the above-described conditions and nucleoid type I and II sedimentation, as examined by Lebkowski and Laemmli (1982) we conclude that damage at two levels of DNA folding is measured at pH 6.9 and 9." .

They can result in the changes of the absorption spectra. Simultaneously, erythrosine fades obviously and the maximum fading wavelength is located at 526 nm. The fading reactions have high sensitivities. Thus, new spectrophotometries of determination for these drugs are developed. The ion-association reactions result in the quenching of fluorescence, which also have high sensitivities. The detection limits for six antibiotics are in the range of 7.1–12.2 μg·L−1. Furthermore, the reactions can result in the enhancement of resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS). The maximum scattering peaks of six ion-association complexes are located at 566 nm, and there are two small RRS peaks at 333 nm and 287 nm. The detection limits for fluoroquinolone antibiotics are in the range of 1.70–3.10 μg·L−1 for RRS method. Among the above three methods, the RRS method has the highest sensitivity.

Vector magnetic fields observed on the photospheric surface can be taken as the boundary conditions of this equation. In this numerical computation, the following two points are emphasized: (1) A new method for data reduction is proposed, for removing uncertainties in boundary data and determining the parameter in this Green's function, which is important for solving the boundary integral equation. In this method, the transverse components of the observed boundary field are calibrated with a linear force-free field model without changing their azimuth. (2) The computed 3-D fields satisfy the divergence-free and force-free conditions with high precision. The alignment of these field lines is mostly in agreement with structures in Hα and Yohkoh soft X-ray images. Since the boundary data are calibrated with a linear force-free field model, the computed 3-D magnetic field can be regarded as a quasi-linear force-free field approximation. The reconstruction of 3-D magnetic field in active region NOAA 7321 was taken as an example to quantitatively exhibit the capability of our new numerical technique." .

However, we have almost no information on the triboplasma generation inside of the sliding contact. This is because the intensity of the photon emission from the inside of the sliding contact is too weak to be detected compared to that from the high-intensity rear outside plasma. On the other hand, plasma generated at the front outside of the contact was also difficult to observe since the intensity was also so weak. In the present article, the author investigated the triboplasma generation at the inside, front outside and very vicinity of the sliding contact together with the rear outside of the sliding contact by measuring the two-dimensional images and intensities of the UV, visible and IR photons emitted from the sliding contact while sliding a diamond pin with a 4-mm tip radius on a sapphire disk in dry sliding in dry air under a normal force of 2 N and a sliding velocity of 34 cm/s. The results showed that extremely weak triboplasma is generated even in the small asperity gap of the sliding contact, that the sliding contact is surrounded by weak circular plasma and that weak plasma is generated further in the front of the sliding contact. Namely, four kinds of triboplasma were observed inside and outside of the sliding contact including the previously reported rear outside high-intensity plasma, (1) weak front outside plasma, (2) weaker circular outside plasma surrounding the contact, (3) weakest inside plasma and (4) high-intensity plasma, visible at the rear outside of the contact. Based on the experimental results, a new model of triboelectromagnetic phenomena has been proposed." .

Our predictions are rather pessimistic for the upcoming experiments NOMAD and CHORUS, which, we find, are able to explore only a small area of the oscillation parameter space. On the other hand, the discovery potential of future experiments is much larger. We consider three examples. E803, which is approved to operate in the future Fermilab main injector beam line, MINOS, a proposed long-baseline experiment also using the Fermilab beam, and NAUSICAA, an improved detector which improves by an order of magnitude the performance of CHORUS/NOMAD and can be operated either at CERN or at Fermilab beams.

The fine structure of the pellicle — the plasma membrane and the outer layer existing outside this plasma membrane — of each stage was studied by freeze-fracture technique. By this technique,P. carinii was cleaved through the cytoplasm or through the hydrophobic region of the plasma membrane, and the cross-fractured face of the outer layer was revealed on the replicas. The outer layer, which is electron-dense in the thin section, consisted of numerous fine granules about 15 nm in diameter in freeze-fracture images, whereas the electron-lucent middle layer which appeared in the precyst and cyst was less granular. Measurement of the intramembranous particles (IMP) also was carried out. The number of IMP per square micrometer of the plasma membrane of the trophozoite was 1,512±125 on the P face and 417±44 on the E face. In the precyst, the IMP density decreased, and 1,037±56 on the P face and 262±22 on the E face. In the cyst, it further decreased, and 875±59 and 150±20 respectively. It is generally assumed that the density of IMP is related to the physiological activity of the cell membrane, so that the present results obtained inP. carinii suggest that the trophozoite is the most active stage, and that metabolic activity of the pellicle gradually decreases with the progress of development to the precyst then to the cyst." .

But these treatments did not change the period or shift the phase of the cycle. When the strand was stretched instantaneously by as much as 30–50% of the whole length, the oscillation in tension production became irregular or even disappeared for a while. Nevertheless, the waves recovered subsequently were found in the phase which was anticipated through extrapolation from the waves before stretching. These facts suggest the presence of a latent cycle, a phase which advances independently of the externally applied forces." .

The tunable source is an optically pumped far infrared laser which has been used from 160 GHz up to 525 GHz with magnetic fields of up to 19 T. We present measurements performed in semiconductor physics and in molecular chemical physics. These measurements allowed us to distinguish electric dipolar transitions from magnetic dipolar transitions. The increase ing-factor resolution was used to discriminate between entities withg-factors differing by a few 10−5. This property together with the study of the line-width frequency dependence was used in geophysics. We studied the spin relaxation mechanisms of the model system Phosphorus doped Silicon.

A flux-rope model, in conjunction with 3D triangulations, has been used to reconstruct the 3D structures and determine the actual speeds of CMEs. The origin and the dynamic evolution of the CMEs are investigated using COR1, COR2 and EUVI images. We have identified four types of solar surface activities associated with CMEs: i) total eruptive prominence (totEP), ii) partially eruptive prominence (PEP), iii) X-ray flare, and iv) X-type magnetic structure (X-line). Among the 27 CMEs, 18.5% (5 of 27) are associated with totEPs, 29.6% (8 of 27) are associated with PEPs, 26% (7 of 27) are flare related, and 26% (7 of 27) are associated with X-line structures, and 43% (3 of 7) are associated with both X-line structures and PEPs. Three (11%) could not be associated with any detectable activity.

This ratio is used as a diagnostic for determining the density of the hot coronal plasma surrounding prominences. We found that the electron density is higher at the location of the prominences than in the corona, whereas small regions (∼40″) of lower electron density are unevenly distributed around the prominences indicating that the surrounding corona is highly inhomogeneous. The density of the cavity is reduced by a factor 1.5 compared to the density of the prominence environment (∼5 × 108 cm−3).

Two functions derived from the quantum stress tensor have been evaluated according to their ability to serve as shell indicators. The influence of λ is analyzed and the consequences for the representation of the atomic shell structure are discussed in detail. It is found that the trace of the stress tensor does not fully reveal the atomic shell structure. In contrast, the scaled trace (whereby the scaling function is proportional to the Thomas-Fermi kinetic energy density) produces fairly good representation of the atomic shell structure over a wide range of λ values." .

(2) Those ejecta seem to start before HXR or related decimetric radio continua (DCIM emission). (3) DCIM occurring nearly simultaneously with the first HXR peak are located very close to the HXR source. Later in the flare, DCIM generally becomes stronger, drifts to lower frequency and occurs far from the HXR source. Thus the positions at high frequency are generally closer to the HXR source. DCIM emission consists of pulses that drift in frequency. The very high and sometimes positive drift rate suggests spatially extended sources or type III like beams in an inhomogeneous source.

The range of safe temperature increases is defined asT 0<T L , whereT L is the smallest value of the temperature rise at which a deformed state of equilibrium (thus, a buckled state) becomes possible. The post-buckling equilibrium states are determined analytically. To obtain a consistent formulation of the problem use is made of the principle of virtual displacements and the variational calculus for variable matching points. The obtained formulations are nonlinear, but can be solved exactly. Solutions are presented for four buckled configurations. The results are presented graphically for a typical railroad track presently in use on main lines. The obtained results are compared with the corresponding results of other investigators." .

The major sources of the dust population in the inner solar system are comets and asteroids, but the relative contributions of these sources are not quantified. The production processes inward from 1 AU are: Poynting-Robertson deceleration of particles outside of 1 AU, fragmentation into dust due to particle-particle collisions, and direct dust production from comets. The loss processes are: dust collisional fragmentation, sublimation, radiation pressure acceleration, sputtering, and rotational bursting. These loss processes as well as dust surface processes release dust compounds in the ambient interplanetary medium. Between 1 and 0.1 AU the dust number densities and fluxes can be described by inward extrapolation of 1 AU measurements, assuming radial dependences that describe particles in close to circular orbits. Observations have confirmed the general accuracy of these assumptions for regions within 30° latitude of the ecliptic plane. The dust densities are considerably lower above the solar poles but Lorentz forces can lift particles of sizes < 5 μm to high latitudes and produce a random distribution of small grains that varies with the solar magnetic field. Also long-period comets are a source of out-of-ecliptic particles. Under present conditions no prominent dust ring exists near the Sun. We discuss the recent observations of sungrazing comets. Future in-situ experiments should measure the complex dynamics of small dust particles, identify the contribution of cometary dust to the inner-solar-system dust cloud, and determine dust interactions in the ambient interplanetary medium. The combination of in-situ dust measurements with particle and field measurements is recommended." .

The propagation (or leakage) of these p-mode signals into the higher solar atmosphere is one of the key drivers of oscillatory motions in the higher solar chromosphere and corona. This paper examines numerically the direct propagation of acoustic waves driven harmonically at the photosphere, into the nonmagnetic solar atmosphere. Erdélyi et al. (Astron. Astrophys. 467, 1299, 2007) investigated the acoustic response to a single point-source driver. In the follow-up work here we generalise this previous study to more structured, coherent, photospheric drivers mimicking solar global oscillations. When our atmosphere is driven with a pair of point drivers separated in space, reflection at the transition region causes cavity oscillations in the lower chromosphere, and amplification and cavity resonance of waves at the transition region generate strong surface oscillations.

The model is the first consistent one of this type in that i) spurious contributions to the transition amplitude due to nonorthogonality of approximate correlated initial and final nuclear states are eliminated and ii) the model transition amplitude is developed in a well-behaved cluster expansion, with terms arranged in increasing order in a smallness parameter characterizing the correlations. The zeroth-order term gives the conventional shell model description. Explicit expressions for the transition amplitude valid to first order in the effects of the correlations are derived for use in analyses of the (γ,N) and (γ, 2N) data, under the special assumption that the correlations in initial and final states are of the same Jastrow form." .

Three steps in this production technique are included for concave microlens array formations to be integrated into microfluidic systems. First, using the photoresist SU-8 to produce hexagonal microchannel array is required. Second, UV curable glue is injected into the hexagonal microchannel array. Third, the surplus glue is rotated by a spinner at high velocity and exposed to a UV lamp to harden the glue. The micro concave lens molds are then finished and ready to produce convex microlens in poly methsiloxane (PDMS) material. This convex microlens in PDMS can be used for detecting fluorescence in microfluidic channels because a convex microlens plays the light convergence role for optical fiber detection." .

For thin film displacement, the restoration of inward elasticity needs to be overcome. During thin film displacement, attraction due to suction occurs when coming into contact with light waveguide; electrostatic force and elastic force are restored and mutually balanced, causing display to light up. On the other hand, when input voltage is released, electrostatic force stops and thin film is restored to original position, causing display to darken. The design structure uses SU-8 as supporting posts, and PDMS as the electrostatic thin film suspended above the glass substrate (light waveguide). The experimental results show that a waveguide with an electrode length of 250 μm (sub-pixel length), a micro-post height of 27 μm, and a PDMS film thickness of 16 μm requires an actuator voltage of 314 V; and a micro-post height of 27 μm, and a PDMS film thickness of 8 μm requires an actuator voltage of 189 V.

So far, the loop configuration has been discussed on a rather schematic basis, because of insufficient data coverage. However, now we have data obtained with various advanced instruments, which are essentially important to define the three-dimensional magnetic configuration of flare loops. In this paper, we briefly present how the loop configuration of the solar flares can be determined based on recent advanced observations. We focus on the flares caused by emerging flux activity in region NOAA 8100, which appeared in October–November 1997. We present here the presumed quadruple structure of the magnetic loops of the analyzed flares in three dimensions, and suggest that the emergence of small loops can give rise to large-scale phenomena like jets and CMEs." .

This approach enables us to directly obtain the spectral function from the sum rules, without having to introduce any specific assumption about its functional form. QCD sum rules for heavy quarkonia incorporate finite temperature effects in form of changing values of the various gluonic condensates that appear in the operator product expansion. These changes depend on the energy density and pressure at finite temperature, which we extract from quenched lattice QCD calculations. As a result, it is found that the charmonium ground states of both S-wave and P-wave channels dissolve into the continuum already at temperatures around or slightly above the critical temperature T c , while the bottomonium states are less influenced by temperature effects, surviving up to about 2.5 T c or higher for S-wave and about 2.0 T c for P-wave states." .

One model of this behavior is a channel consisting of several parallel pores with a strong correlation between the flux in each pore such that, normally, they all conduct together but, under special circumstances, the pores may transfer to a state in which only some of them conduct. This paper introduces a general technique for modeling correlated pores, and explores in detail by computer simulation a particular model based upon electric interaction between the pores. Correlation is obtained when the transient electric field of ions passing through the pores acts upon a common set of ionizable residues of the channel protein, causing transient changes in their effective pK and hence in their charged state. The computed properties of such a correlated parallel pore channel with single occupation of each pore are derived and compared to those predicted for a single pore that can contain more than one ion at a time and also to those predicted for a model pore with fluctuating barriers. Experiments that could distinguish between the present and previous models are listed." .

POCS is technically more difficult and thus has a lower success rate, but is far less time-consuming and causes fewer complications than PTCS. The technical equipment employed for POCS should be further improved. In selected patients, laser application via PTCS is an uncomplicated but highly efficient method; however, the rate of complications and the time needed to establish a transhepatic tract continue to cause problems." .

It is shown that the errors for small-diameter wear tracks relative to the contact width are lower for sphere-on-flat (Hertzian) contact geometries than circular flat-on-flat contact geometries. Small-diameter experiments result in surprisingly small errors for Hertzian contact pressure distribution. Angular misalignments further collude to increase the error in measured friction coefficient for small track-diameter-to-contact-width ratios, converging to the cosine error for large track-diameter-to-contact-width ratios." .

The numerical hydrodynamicall code describing the formation and evolution of a protostellar disk in a two-dimensional approximation is supplemented by one-dimensional code for the evolution of the star and an algorithm for establishing the vertical structure of the disk. This code is used to investigate the influence of luminosity bursts with intensities similar to those observed in FU Orionis objects (FUors) on the properties and thermal balance of protostellar disks. A model with gravitational instability and fragmentation of the disk, with subsequent migration of the fragments onto the protostar, is used as a basic model for FUors. Typical FUor bursts (L ∼ 100 L ⊙) can appreciably influence the thermal balance of their disks and parent envelopes, leading to an increase in the disk temperature by more than a factor of two. On the other hand, massive fragments in the disk are only weakly perturbed by such bursts, partially due to screening by the disk and partially due to their high temperature brought about by adiabatic heating. Apart from massive fragments, the characteristic thermal time scales are appreciably shorter than the dynamical time scales throughout the radial extent of the disk and envelope; this enables the use of a stationary radiative-transfer equation when determining the vertical structure of the disk." .

The mechanism is essentially a set of precisely designed parallel chevron beams that replace one of the fixed ends of the micro-bridge. The axial stress/force of the beam is determined by utilizing a sensing mechanism that makes use of two side-electrodes and the electromechanical buckling of the micro-bridge toward one of them. A combination of analytical and finite element methods has been employed for the modeling of the proposed mechanism. It has been demonstrated that the regulator mechanism has negligible dynamic effect on the sensing micro-beam. The model takes into account the effect of electric field fringes between the electrically charged bodies. It has been shown that there is a time delay between the moment that the pull-in occurs and the instant that the sensing beam rests on a side-electrode. The results of the modeling are verified by experiment on two devices fabricated using MetalMUMPs® fabrication technology. The thermal stress sensitivities of the devices are positive and their residual stresses are in excellent agreement." .

It is shown that these requirements make it possible to fix the form of the operators of the two-body interactions. The problem is solved with allowance for the dependence of the interaction operators on the spectral parameter. This dependence is a manifestation of the structure of the particles in the three-body system (i.e., it reflects the circumstance that the complete Hilbert space of state vectors of the system includes not only three-body configurations of the original particles) and leads to the appearance of certain factors in the cross sections of physical processes. Two alternative formulations of the method are investigated. In the first formulation, equations are written down for the amplitudes of transitions between free-particle states. In the second formulation, the states of interacting particles in the two-body scattering channels are used as complete orthogonal bases. Partial-wave expansions of the equations with respect to states with given total angular momentum of the system in the helicity basis are made." .

In particular a solution of the 3-D Poisson equation using 2-D Fourier transforms is presented. The improved nonlinear force-free method is demonstrated in application to linear force-free test cases with localized nonzero values of the normal component of the field in the boundary. These fields provide suitable test cases for nonlinear force-free calculations because the boundary conditions involve localized nonzero values of the normal components of the field and of the current density, and because (being linear force-free fields) they have more direct numerical solutions. Despite their simplicity, fields of this kind have not been recognized as test cases for nonlinear methods before. The examples illustrate the treatment of the boundary conditions on current in the nonlinear force-free method, and in particular the limitations imposed by field lines that connect outside of the boundary region." .

Radio-metric tracking data received from a number of spacecraft that experienced an Earth gravity assist indicate the presence of an unexpected energy change that happened during the flyby and cannot be explained by the standard methods of modern astrodynamics. This puzzling behavior of several spacecraft has become known as the flyby anomaly. We present the summary of the recent anomalous observations and discuss possible ways to resolve this puzzle." .

The associate problem of the determination of the particle multiplicity on both multi-event and event-by-event basis is formulated and discussed. It is shown that a multi-event data analysis procedure allows an accurate determination of the multipolicity distribution of the emitted particles even with not necessarily large total efficiency and granularity detection systems. In the event-by-event data analysis procedure a fold-to-multiplicity conversion based on the Bayes strategy is adopted. It is shown that a reliable event-by-event multiplicity determination and multiplicity resolution definition cannot prescind from a multi-event analysis of the full data set. It is found that the resolution of the event-by-event fold-to-multiplicity conversion procedure depends on the characteristics of the detection system, but not exclusively. The dependence on the particular multiplicity distribution investigated is discussed. It is concluded that event-by-event high-resolution impact parameter measurements can only be performed with very efficient and granular detection systems, but a gross event classification into central and peripheral collisions can be performed even with detection efficiency as low asΩ=0.3." .

The Tsyganenko empirical field model, which is based on vast satellite field data, provides a realistic description of magnetic field configuration in the magnetosphere. When the force balance under the static condition is assumed, the electromagnetic J×B force from the Tsyganenko field model can be used to infer the plasma pressure and anisotropy distributions consistent with the field model. It is found that the J×B force obtained from the Tsyganenko field model is not curl-free. The curl-free part of the J×B force in an empirical field model can be balanced by the gradient of the isotropic pressure, while the nonzero curl of the J×B force can only be associated with the pressure anisotropy. The plasma pressure and anisotropy in the near-Earth plasma sheet are numerically calculated to obtain a static equilibrium consistent with the Tsyganenko field model both in the noon-midnight meridian and in the equatorial plane. The plasma pressure distribution deduced from the Tsyganenko 1989 field model is highly anisotropic and shows this feature early in the substorm growth phase. The pressure anisotropy parameter <alpha> P , defined as <alpha> P =1-P\\VertP⊥, is typically \\sim0.3 at x\\approx-4.5R E and gradually decreases to a small negative value with an increasing tailward distance. The pressure anisotropy from the Tsyganenko 1989 model accounts for 50% of the cross-tail current at maximum and only in a highly localized region near x\\sim-10R E . In comparison, the plasma pressure anisotropy inferred from the Tsyganenko 1987 model is much smaller. We also find that the boundary conditions have significant effects on the plasma pressure distributions and have to be considered carefully." .

Several techniques and tools are available for measuring and predicting residual stresses. For example, neutron diffraction (ND) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) are non-destructive techniques used for measuring through-thickness and surface residual stresses respectively, while the deep-hole drilling (DHD) and the incremental centre-hole drilling (ICHD) are semi-destructive techniques and measure through-thickness and sub-surface residual stress respectively. In most open literature, a more favoured method is traditionally used over others, with some degree of validation using finite element analysis (FEA) predictive tool. In this paper it will be shown that the different methods and tools available are not contradicting or more superior to the others, but rather, the use of more than one available technique complementary to each other can improve the quality and the confidence in the characterisation of the residual stress state in an engineering component. In particular, the accurate knowledge of the residual stress field for a safety critical component plays a vital role for subsequent structural integrity assessment." .

The critical flexural speeds are easily cut off and the whirl amplitude is minimized throughout the frequency range. Confining the usual operative angular speed of the rotor in the range of adhesive contact between the dry friction surfaces, there is no significant increase of power dissipation or heat production as a whole due to this type of suspension system, whose task is just to suppress the resonant peaks when passing the critical speeds. Moreover, the wear of the rubbing surfaces can be easily compensated by use of suitable spring loading systems for the friction contact. The dry friction damping is also compared with an equivalent viscous damping, where the equivalence has to be understood in terms of work dissipated per single revolution of the rotor. As for other conventional cases, the shaft hysteresis is found to exert a destabilizing effect above the first critical speed, which however can be compensated by the other dissipation sources. The system stability is here studied perturbing the periodic motion and applying the Floquet theory." .

Modelled results are compared to group delay and Doppler shift measurements of whistler mode signals at Faraday, Antarctica (L\\approx2.5), to investigate the effects of disturbed time electric fields on the inner plasmasphere and ionosphere. The disturbed time electric field causes a rapid outward drifting of the plasma leading to a decrease in modelled plasmaspheric electron density at a fixed L-value, which agrees with experimental observations.

Based on complex observational data related to the outstanding solar proton event on 16 February, 1984, the development of burst emission at a height z ≥ 200000 km above the photosphere has been investigated. A comparison with the associated X-ray emission measured aboard various spacecraft yields a time lag of about ≤ 1 min between the onset of the unocculted impulsive HXR-emission and the onsets of the X-ray and microwave emissions occulted by the solar limb. The lag corresponds to a range of speeds of the propagation of the flare volume of about 3000–5000 km s−1. Considering competing transport agents that could account for such expansion of the source volume, a qualitative model of shock-wave activation of loops successively reaching into larger coronal heights is proposed. From a discussion of the possible emission processes involved, conclusions about the magnetic field, electron density, and particle energies have been obtained." .

The results from simulation using the method of dimensionality reduction show that the frictional energy dissipation increases firstly with coefficient of friction, and then almost symmetrically decreases to a constant. The fiber aspect ratio has an important effect on the energy dissipation and this effect becomes more significant for larger coefficient of friction. The simulation results for very large coefficient of friction show a good agreement with the analytical solution for the case of infinite coefficient of friction." .

The comparison of diffraction curves of two similar samples, with and without nitrogen, together with an assumption of constant indium incorporation efficiency during the growth of layers with and without nitrogen, may lead to a large deviation in the determined In and N content. The HRXRD curve simulations supported by bandgap determination and calculations seem to be a solution of this problem. Comparison of the results achieved from simulated HRXRD curves with the calculations of all QWs transitions measured by contactless electro-reflectance (CER) can lead to reduction of deviations in composition determination of InGaAsN quantum wells. The proposed algorithm was applied for investigation of InGaAsN QWs grown by atmospheric pressure metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (APMOVPE)." .

It is demonstrated that in the presence of the defect, a narrow transmission miniband is formed in the non-transmission band gap of the defectless crystal. In this case, the field is strongly localized in the defect region depending on the defect type, its position, and the number of complete periods in the structure. The formation of the double defect of inversion type leads to the formation of two defect minibands in the spectrum and the redistribution of the wave field in the structure." .

The novel structural features associated with the halo phenomena have been the subject for extensive theoretical and experimental investigations in recent times. In this talk, I propose to present a broad overview of the recent developments in this field, bringing out the striking features which show that a large number oflight nuclei near the neutron drip line are characterized by a clear separation between a ‘normal’ core nucleus and a loosely bound low density veil of neutrons. Specifically, the two neutron halos offer a natural premises, from a theoretical standpoint, to employ three body techniques for studying their detailed structural properties. A considerable part of the talk will be devoted to report and highlight the results on a number of light halo nuclei such as 11Li, 11Be, 19B and 22C on which we have been carrying out investigations employing a simple but realistic three body model. These three body systems which have been termed as ‘Borromean’ (i.e while three body systems are bound, the corresponding binary subsystems on the other hand are unbound) are characterized by large spacial extension and very low separation energy of the neutron. They are, therefore, ideally suited for exploring the possibility of the existence of Efimov states in two neutron halo nuclei. We have recently carried out the three body analyses to predict the possibility of the occurrence of such states on which experimental work at various laboratories is underway." .

B 1974,30, 1874], whereas the latter was reported to crystallize as a racemate [Allemand and Gerdi,Cryst. Struct. Commun. 1979,8, 927]. As we show in what follows, we had planned to justify these observations via molecular mechanics and semiempirical (AM1) calculations. However, in the process of doing some geometrical calculations unavailable in the original, we found that it was impossible for the reported structure [Riche and Pascard-Billy,op. cit.] to be correct. Therefore, we redetermined the structure and found that triphenylmethane also crystallizes as a racemate. The compound was recrystallized from toluene and its structure was solved in space groupPna21 (No. 33). The cell constants area=25.593(14),b=14.804(19),c=7.521(15) å;V=2849.5(6) å3,d(MW=244.32 g mol−1;z=8)=1.139 g cm−3. A total of 2183 independent reflections were collected over the range 4‡ ≤ 2θ ≥40‡. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined using rigid-body constraints for the three phenyl rings as a result of the large, and unfavorable, ratio of variables/observed data had the individual atoms been refined. Molecular mechanics (HyperChem) calculations were carried out to ascertain the degree of agreement between the observed structural parameters and those obtained from an energy-minimized structure. The agreement is remarkably good, especially given the quality of the X-ray data. Similar comments can be applied to the results obtained by semiempirical (AM1) calculations (in HyperChem). Thus, this is a satisfying agreement lending weight to the suggestion that the X-ray data are very reasonable, even if flawed. Calculations were also carried out to determine a conformational potential surface for the molecule as a function of rotation of the phenyl rings around their HC-C(phenyl) vector. These calculations indicate a shallow minimum around the conformation with C3 symmetry with torsional angles [H-C-C(head)-C(ortho) of 30‡, 30‡, 30‡], as well as possible low-energy pathways between molecules of opposite axial chirality." .

Comparing the results with those neglecting all final state interactions, one finds that the Σ0 production can be enhanced by a factor ∼6 while the Λ0 production is increased by only ∼10%. The most recent experimental results on the branching ratio of the two hyperon-productions can now be fit with a less extreme assumption about the spin dependence of the transition matrix for the reaction Σ−+p→Σ0+n, although an appreciable amount of spin dependence is still required. The effect of the dineutron final state interaction on the Λ0 momentum spectrum is calculated as a function of the spin dependence of the Λ0 production process. The present experimental data, however, are not sufficient to determine this spin dependence." .

We show that this leads to the appearance of complex tunnelling amplitudes and allows for the implementation of spatial non-adiabatic passage.

Hence, only the fluorophores within a thin volume of the specimen are excited. This reduces photo-bleaching and photo-toxic effects by several orders of magnitude compared with any other form of microscopy. Therefore, LSFM (aka single/selective-plane illumination microscopy [SPIM] or digitally scanned light sheet microscopy [DSLM]) is the technique of choice for the three-dimensional imaging of live or fixed and of small or large three-dimensional specimens. The parallel recording of millions of pixels with modern cameras provides an extremely fast acquisition speed.

Tunable laser absorption spectroscopy in the mid-infrared wavelength region is used for sensitive trace gas sensing of exhaled carbon monoxide (CO).

The optical sensors integrate a slow feedback system to correct for wavelength drifts improving their stability over days. Both approaches demonstrate a high reproducibility and sensitivity during online measurements of exhaled human breath. Considering the detection limit to be the equal to the standard deviation of the background fluctuations, the noise-equivalent detection limit for both OA-ICOS and WMS is 7 ppbv (1-s averaging time), leading to a noise-equivalent absorption sensitivity of 3.1 × 10−7 cm−1 Hz−1/2, which is sufficient for measurements of exhaled CO (eCO).

This recent discovery has prompted a re-examination of past measurements of magnetic fields in prominences. This re-examination indicates that Rust (1967), in his interpretation of solar cycle 20 measurements in terms of the Kippenhahn-Schlüter model, and Leroy, Bommier, and Sahal-Bréchot (1984), in their interpretation of solar cycle 21 measurements in terms of the Kuperus-Raadu model were both misled by the global pattern of helicity. While the original magnetic field measurements are consistent with the new results about heliform magnetic fields in filaments, neither of the well-known classes of two-dimensional models can produce both the proper axial field direction and the observed pattern of helicity. A global, subsurface velocity pattern that would twist the fields before emergence as filaments seems to be required. In this paper a twisted-flux-rope model consistent with the new understanding of filament fields is presented. The model is based on a constant-α solution of the magnetostatic equations, where electric current densityj(r) =α B(r). The model filament has dimensions in general agreement with observations. It is shown to be stable if the length is less than 140 000 km to 1,400 000 km, depending on the value ofα. The model also provides a new explanation of eruptive prominences and for the origin of the entrained material." .

The asymmetry (N n − N s )/(N n + N s ) is 0.06 ± 0.004 at the threshold energy release in the calorimeter and gradually decreases with increasing energy release. The observed effect is shown to be produced by electrons in the energy range 10–100 GeV." .

The Aedes aegypti mosquito is a vector of several diseases in humans like yellow fever and dengue. Vector control methods involving the use of chemical insecticides are becoming less effective due to development of insecticides resistance, biological magnification of toxic substances through the food chain, and adverse effects on environmental quality and non-target organisms including human health. Application of active toxic agents from plant extracts as an alternative mosquito control strategy was available from ancient times. These are nontoxic, easily available at affordable prices, biodegradable, and show broad-spectrum target-specific activities against different species of vector mosquitoes. Today, nanotechnology is a promising research domain which has wide-ranging application vector control programs. The present study investigates the larvicidal potential of solvent leaf extracts of Leucas aspera and synthesized silver nanoparticles using aqueous leaf extract against fourth instar larvae of Aedes aegypti. Larvae were exposed to varying concentrations of plant extracts and synthesized AgNPs for 24 h. The results were recorded from UV–Vis spectra, x-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and were used to characterize and support the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles. The formation of the AgNPs synthesized from the XRD spectrum compared with Bragg reflections can be indexed to the (111) orientations, respectively, confirmed the presence of AgNPs. The FT-IR spectra of AgNPs exhibited prominent peaks at 3,447.77; 2,923.30; and 1,618.66 cm−1. The spectra showed sharp and strong absorption band at 1,618.66 cm−1 assigned to the stretching vibration of (NH) C═O group. The band 1,383 developed for C═C and C═N stretching, respectively, and was commonly found in the proteins. SEM analysis of the synthesized AgNPs clearly showed the clustered and irregular shapes, mostly aggregated, and having the size of 25–80 nm. Energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy showed the complete chemical composition of the synthesized AgNPs. In larvicidal activity, the results showed that the maximum efficacy was observed in synthesized AgNPs leaf extracts against the fourth instar larvae of A. aegypti (LC50 values of 8.5632, 10.0361, 14.4689, 13.4579, 17.4108, and 27.4936 mg/l) and (LC90 values of 21.5685, 93.03928, 39.6485, 42.2029, 31.3009, and 53.2576 mg/l), respectively. These results suggest that the synthesized AgNPs leaf extracts have a higher larvicidal potential as compared to crude solvent extracts thus making them an effective combination for controlling A. aegypti." .

The effects of the static nuclear magnetic field are shown to be very small. We calculate the effects of the nuclear Coulomb field by constructing the Green’s function appropriate for pions moving in the Coulomb field of an extended nucleus and using realistic muon wave functions. Consideration of finite nuclear size is shown to be imperative in order to obtain accurate results. The Coulomb corrections are not large enough to play any significant role in understanding the discrepancy of the theory with the recent measurement of the photon spectrum following radiative muon capture in40Ca of the rate of the reaction16O(μ−,νμ)16N(0−).

Changes in the large scale structure of the magnetic field lead to short- and long term changes in cosmic ray intensities, in particular in anti-phase with solar activity. The origin of the HMF in the corona is well understood and inner heliospheric observations can generally be linked to their coronal sources. The structure of heliospheric magnetic polarities and the heliospheric current sheet separating the dominant solar polarities are reviewed here over longer than a solar cycle, using the three dimensional heliospheric observations by Ulysses. The dynamics of the HMF around solar minimum activity is reviewed and the development of stream interaction regions following the stable flow patterns of fast and slow solar wind in the inner heliosphere is described. The complex dynamics that affects the evolution of the stream interaction regions leads to a more chaotic structure of the HMF in the outer heliosphere is described and discussed on the basis of the Voyager observations. Around solar maximum, solar activity is dominated by frequent transients, resulting in the interplanetary counterparts of Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs). These produce a complex aperiodic pattern of structures in the inner heliosphere, at all heliolatitudes. These structures continue to interact and evolve as they travel to the outer heliosphere. However, linking the observations in the inner and outer heliospheres is possible in the case of the largest solar transients that, despite their evolutions, remain recognizably large structures and lead to the formation of Merged Interaction Regions (MIRs) that may well form a quasi-spherical, “global” shell of enhanced magnetic fields around the Sun at large distances. For the transport of energetic particles and cosmic rays, the fluctuations in the magnetic field and their description in alternative turbulent models remains a very important research topic. These are also briefly reviewed in this paper." .

The observations were carried out with the specialized solar telescope (D = 23 cm,F = 3 m) and grating spectrometer (F = 2 m, grating 140 × 150 mm, 600 grooves mm−1). The ribbon tungsten lamps used for absolute calibration were calibrated to the USSR standard of spectral intensity and were also compared with the irradiance standard of the PMO/WRC (Davos, Switzerland), with the lamps used in the Alma-Ata Observatory (Kazakhstan) and in Simferopol University for absolute measurements of stellar spectra. Methods and apparatus were improving step by step during 1985–1988. Special care was paid to the study of all possible sources of errors, in particular to the method of correction for atmospheric extinction, to polarization properties of optical elements of the apparatus, and to establishing the most reliable absolute calibration system. Finally, the observations performed during 1989 utilized only the refined methods and apparatus. As a result, the absolute integrals of the solar disk-centre intensity for 1-nm wide spectral bands in the range 310–685 nm are available. We estimate the total error is 2.5% at 310 nm and 2.1% at 680 nm. The absolute irradiance for 5-nm wide spectral bands is also obtained. We compare our results with results by Neckel and Labs (1984), with the irradiance filter measurements performed in PMO/WRC and calibration of the Sun's spectral irradiance to the stellar irradiance standard Vega by Lockwood (1992). Our results show a systematic difference with data by Neckel and Labs in the near-ultraviolet. The results by Neckel and Labs are probably underestimated in this spectral range by 8%." .

Compared to direct methods such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), MRCP is not painful, does not require contrast media, and its success does not depend, to any great extent, on the operator's skill. It uses three-dimensional data sets for projection images, as well as arbitrary cross-sectional iamges. Faster data acquisition techniques are expanding its indications as a diagnostic tool. MRCP is undoubtedly the method of choice when ERCP is contraindicated or fails. Imaging after the injection of secretin improves pancreatic duct delineation, and may also add functional information to MRCP. Adequate diagnostic evaluation of acute pancreatitis, pancreatic trauma, and mucinous ductal ectasia may also be feasible. Further development and optimization of MRCP will substantially limit the indications for diagnostic endoscopic pancreatography." .

In a permanent MRI system, shimming rings are commonly used to improve field homogeneity. However, the optimization of the ring structure is challenging owing to the nonlinear properties of the ferromagnetic material. To design a small permanent magnet system, this study explores the application of sensitivity analysis (SA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for the optimization of shimming rings. SA is used to identify the most important parameter of the shimming rings that affects the quality of the magnetic field to simplify the optimization process and improve optimization accuracy and efficiency. PSO is used to solve the complex and nonlinear optimizations of the magnetic field. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a specific permanent MRI magnet was modeled. The results show that the inner radius of the shimming ring crucially affects magnetic field quality, with ring height having relatively smaller impact. Compared with the PSO-only optimization procedure, the combined SA-PSO optimization more rapidly converges to a better solution. The optimized shimming rings significantly improve the magnetic field uniformity (~10 fold) compared with that of the initial magnet without shimming rings." .

More recently, we have extended this tomography technique to use remote-sensing data from the Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI) on board the Coriolis spacecraft; from the Ootacamund (Ooty) radio telescope in India; and from the European Incoherent SCATter (EISCAT) radar telescopes in northern Scandinavia. Finally, we intend these analyses to be used with observations from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), or the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) now being developed respectively in Australia and Europe. In this article we demonstrate how in-situ velocity measurements from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) space-borne instrumentation can be used in addition to remote-sensing data to constrain the time-dependent tomographic solution. Supplementing the remote-sensing observations with in-situ measurements provides additional information to construct an iterated solar-wind parameter that is propagated outward from near the solar surface past the measurement location, and throughout the volume. While the largest changes within the volume are close to the radial directions that incorporate the in-situ measurements, their inclusion significantly reduces the uncertainty in extending these measurements to global 3-D reconstructions that are distant in time and space from the spacecraft. At Earth, this can provide a finely-tuned real-time measurement up to the latest time for which in-situ measurements are available, and enables more-accurate forecasting beyond this than remote-sensing observations alone allow." .

A prediction of their geoeffectiveness and travel time to Earth’s vicinity is crucial to forecast space weather. Unfortunately, coronagraphic observations are subjected to projection effects and do not provide true characteristics of CMEs. Recently, Michalek (Solar Phys. 237, 101, 2006) developed an asymmetric cone model to obtain the space speed, width, and source location of HCMEs. We applied this technique to obtain the parameters of all front-sided HCMEs observed by the SOHO/LASCO experiment during a period from the beginning of 2001 until the end of 2002 (solar cycle 23). These parameters were applied for space weather forecasting. Our study finds that the space speeds are strongly correlated with the travel times of HCMEs to Earth’s vicinity and with the magnitudes related to geomagnetic disturbances." .

These observations represent the first imaging polarimetry of comets in the UV, and were performed in consort with ground based measurements of gas and dust polarization and distribution. The continuum results show 9% polarization across the image field with a polarization phase angle close to the 129° prediction. Comparison with ground based data implies minimal color dependence for Hale-Bopp in either the degree of polarization and in the position angle. The carbon polarimetry implies that most production occurs in the dense inner coma, and that it leaves that area in thermodynamic equilibrium. Its radial profile further constrains the carbon outflow speed to be sufficient to travel ≥5 × 106 km without photoionization." .

The energy of the magnetic field (〈B 2〉) is shown to change with longitude. However, these variations hardly fit the concept of active longitudes. In the epochs of high solar activity, one can readily see a relationship between longitude variations of the medium-strong ((|B| > 50 G or |B| > 100 G) and relatively weak (|B| ≤ 50 G or |B| ≤ 100 G) fields at all latitudes. In other periods, this relationship is revealed mainly at the latitudes not higher than 30°. The background fields (|B| ≤ 25 G) also display longitude variations, which are, however, not related to those of the strong fields. This makes us think that the fields of solar activity are rather inclusions to the general field than the source of the latter." .

Coins were most frequently swallowed. The HHMD could detect and locate all coins but only 47% of other MFBs. There were no false-positive results. A HHMD is an effective tool for screening the location of suspected ingested coins. This method is easy, inexpensive and free of radiation. Very small MFBs cannot be reliably detected.

One of the motivations to advance such a theory is to deal properly with collections of items like particles in non-relativistic quantum mechanics when these are understood as being non-individuals in the sense that they may be indistinguishable although identity does not apply to them. According to some authors, this is the best way to understand quantum objects. The fact that identity is not defined for m-atoms raises a technical difficulty: it seems impossible to follow the usual procedures to define the cardinal of collections involving these items.

Improved instrumentation has provided measurement of many vibrational modes in biological samples that previously were lost in noise. With highly optimized sampling conditions, useful measurements have been made with a peak-to-peak noise level less than 5 microabsorbance (5×10−6 absorbance), at 0.5 cm−1 resolution. However, optical and instrumental instabilities often result in sine waves that are not totally removed by the ratio of sample to reference. These often limit effective spectral sensitivity to 50 or 100 microabsorbance, peak-to-peak, and constitute a non-random noise. Non-atmospheric absorptions, especially one at 1959 cm−1 with 0.8 cm−1 band width (FWHM) are reported. The latter is due to a trace impurity in the KBr beam splitter substrate and compensator plate. Improvements in instrumentation and sampling conditions are expected to yield measurements of absorption bands as small as 50 microabsorbance with excellent signal/noise." .

Together with investigations of the dipole (DP) gluon distributions, this can provide valuable information about the polarization of the Color Glass Condensate if sufficiently small x-values are reached. Quarkonia can also be useful in the study of single transverse spin asymmetries. For transversely polarized hadrons the gluon distribution can be asymmetric, which is referred to as the Sivers effect.

Height-time measurements (in the SOHO/LASCO catalog) were used to determine the velocities and accelerations of individual CMEs at successive distances from the Sun. Linear and quadratic functions were fitted to these data points. On the basis of the best fits to the velocity data points, we were able to classify CMEs into four groups. The types of CMEs do not only have different dynamic behaviors but also different masses, widths, velocities, and accelerations. We also show that these groups of events are initiated by different onset mechanisms. The results of our study allow us to present a consistent classification of CMEs based on their dynamics." .

DCM for M/EEG entails the inversion a full spatiotemporal model of evoked responses, over multiple conditions. This model rests on a biophysical and neurobiological generative model for electrophysiological data. A generative model is a prescription of how data are generated. The inversion of a DCM provides conditional densities on the model parameters and, indeed on the model itself. These densities enable one to answer key questions about the underlying system. A DCM comprises two parts; one part describes the dynamics within and among neuronal sources, and the second describes how source dynamics generate data in the sensors, using the lead-field. The parameters of this spatiotemporal model are estimated using a single (iterative) Bayesian procedure. In this paper, we will motivate and describe the current DCM framework. Two examples show how the approach can be applied to M/EEG experiments." .

The observations were made from 18:00 to 08:00 h AST over various days in 1998 and 1999 during the Coqui II Campaign [Urbina et al., 2000, Geophys. Rev. Lett. 27, 2853–2856]. The radar system had two sub-arrays, both produced beams pointed to the north in the magnetic meridian plane, perpendicular to the magnetic field, at an elevation angle of approximately 41 degrees. The Coqui II radar is sensitive to at least two types of echoes from meteor trails: (1) Specular reflections from trails oriented perpendicular to the radar beam, and (2) scattering, or, non-specular reflections, from trails deposited with arbitrary orientations. We examine and compare the diurnal and seasonal variability of echoes from specular and non-specular returns observed with the Coqui II radar. We also compare these results with meteor head echo observations made with the Arecibo 430 MHz radar. We use common region observations of these three types of meteor echoes to show that the diurnal and seasonal variability of specular trails, non-specular trails, and head echoes are not equivalent. The implications of these results on global meteor mass flux estimates obtained from specular meteor observations remains to be examined." .

Spectral transformations of the absorption cross-sections of nanoclusters are illustrated under variation of the radii of particles or theirs nuclei, characteristic lengths of the Thomas-Fermi screening, and frequency of electron collisions.

We show that the plasma velocity increases associated with flux transfer events (FTEs) occur first ∼100–200 km equatorward of the region to which magnetosheath (cusp) precipitation maps to the ionosphere. We suggest that these velocity variations start near the ionospheric footprint of the boundary between open and closed magnetic field lines. We show that these velocity variations have rise times ∼100 s and fall times of ∼10 s. When these velocity transients reach the latitude of the cusp precipitation, sometimes the equatorward boundary of the precipitation begins to move equatorward, the expected and previously reported ionospheric signature of enhanced reconnection. A hypothesis is proposed to explain the velocity variations. It involves the rapid outflow of magnetospheric electrons into the magnetosheath along the most recently reconnected field lines. Several predictions are made arising from the proposed explanation which could be tested with ground-based and space-based observations." .

The high frequency of NPF was observed at GCO under decreased downwelling solar radiation caused by clouds. Although we observed about 15 and 40 % decreases in downwelling surface shortwave radiations, in the presence of thick mid-level (low-level) clouds, on January 28 and 30, 2012, respectively, distinct NPFs with a growth rate of 3.3 (3.9) nm h−1 were observed. We examined a 4-year series (May 2008 to April 2012) of continuous measurements of the size distribution of aerosol numbers and visually observed cloud cover. We found that approximately 13 % (i.e., 35 days out of 280 days) of total NPF events were observed under cloud-free conditions (i.e., cloud cover of 0/10). About 20 % (i.e., 57 days out of 280 days) of total NPF events occurred under mostly overcast conditions (i.e., cloud cover of 9/10–10/10). Although NPF events occurring under cloudy conditions were also found elsewhere, the frequency of NPF occurring at GCO seems much higher. The average value of relative humidity for the strong-NPF event days is lower than that of the weak and non-NPF event days for all cloud categories. No significant difference in the condensation sink was found among strong-, weak-, and non-NPF days, but the condensation sink showed a slight decreasing tendency with increasing cloudiness. Further investigations on precursor gases and preexisting aerosols under cloudy conditions are needed." .

In particular we focus upon the Uemura classification scheme which considers the correlation between the superconducting transition temperature,T c, and the effective Fermi temperature,T F, determined from μSR measurements of the penetration depth. Within this scheme strongly correlated “exotic” superconductors, i.e, hightT C cuprates, heavy fermions, Chevrel phases and the organic superconductors, form a common but distinct group, characterized by a universal scaling ofT C withT F such that 1/100 <T C/T F<1/10. For conventional BCS superconductorsT C/T F<1/1000. The results of new μSR measurements of the penetration depth in superconducting Y(Ni1−x Co x )2B2C and YB6 are also presented. In Y(Ni1−x Co x )2B2C the decrease ofT C with increasing Co concentration is linked to a marked decrease in the carrier density from 2.9·1028 m−3 atx=0 to 0.6·1028 m−3, atx=0.1, while the carrier mass enhancement remains almost constant at approximately 10. For YB6 we find evidence of a modest enhancement of the carrier mass (m */m=3), and a relatively low carrier density of 0.24·1028 m−3. These results are discussed within the Uemura classification scheme. It is found that neither Y(Ni1−x Co x )2B2C withT c/T F>>1/250 nor YB6 withT C/T F>>1/340 can be definitively classified as either “exttic” or “conventional”, but instead the compounds display behavior which interpolates between the two regimes." .

The model results were obtained using the time dependent one-dimensional mathematical model of the Earth’s ionosphere and plasmasphere (the IZMIRAN model). The major enhancement to the IZMIRAN model developed in this study to explain the two component 630 nm emission observed is the analytical yield spectrum approach to calculate the fluxes of precipitating electrons and the additional production rates of N+2, O+2, O+(4S), O+(2D), O−(2P), and O+(2P) ions, and O(1D) in the SAR arc regions in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. In order to bring the measured and modelled electron temperatures into agreement, the additional heating electron rate of 1.05 eV cm−3 s−1 was added in the energy balance equation of electrons at altitudes above 5000 km during the main phase of the geomagnetic storm. This additional heating electron rate determines the thermally excited 630 nm emission observed. The IZMIRAN model calculates a 630 nm integral intensity above 350 km of 4.1 kR and a total 630 nm integral intensity of 8.1 kR, values which are slightly lower compared to the observed 4.7 kR and 10.6 kR. We conclude that the 630 nm emission observed can be explained considering both the soft energy electron excited component and the thermally excited component. It is found that the inclusion of N2(v > 0) and O2(v > 0) in the calculations of the O+(4S) loss rate improves the agreement between the calculated Ne and the data on 4 August, 1972. The N2(v > 0) and O2(v > 0) effects are enough to explain the electron density depression in the SAR arc F-region and above F2 peak altitude. Our calculations show that the increase in the O+ + N2 rate factor due to the vibrationally excited nitrogen produces the 5–19% reductions in the calculated quiet daytime peak density and the 16–24% decrease in NmF2 in the SAR arc region. The increase in the O+ + N2 loss rate due to vibrationally excited O2 produces the 7–26% decrease in the calculated quiet daytime peak density and the 12–26% decrease in NmF2 in the SAR arc region. We evaluated the role of the electron cooling rates by low-lying electronic excitation of O2(a1δg) and O2(b1σg+), and rotational excitation of O2, and found that the effect of these cooling rates on T e can be considered negligible during the quiet and geomagnetic storm period 3–4 August, 1972. The energy exchange between electron and ion gases, the cooling rate in collisions of O(3P) with thermal electrons with excitation of O(1D), and the electron cooling rates by vibrational excitation of O2 and N2 are the largest cooling rates above 200 km in the SAR arc region on 4 August, 1972. The enhanced IZMIRAN model calculates also number densities of N2(B3πg+), N2(C3πu), and N2(A3σu+) at several vibrational levels, O(1S), and the volume emission rate and integral intensity at 557.7 nm in the region between 120 and 1000 km. We found from the model that the integral integral intensity at 557.7 nm is much less than the integral intensity at 630 nm." .

The GS method uses in situ magnetic field and plasma measurements to solve for a magnetohydrostatic quasi-equilibrium state of space plasmas. For some events, a magnetic flux-rope structure embedded within the ICME can be reconstructed. The electron temperature contributes directly to the calculation of the total plasma pressure, and in ICMEs its contribution often substantially exceeds that of proton temperature. We selected ICME events observed with the Wind spacecraft at 1 AU and applied the GS reconstruction method to each event for cases with and without electron temperature measurements. We sorted them according to the proton plasma β (the ratio of proton plasma pressure to magnetic pressure) and the electron-to-proton temperature ratio. We present case studies of three representative events, show the cross sections of GS reconstructed flux-rope structure, and discuss the electron pressure contribution to key quantities in the numerical reconstruction procedure. We summarize and compare the geometrical and physical parameters derived from the GS reconstruction results for cases with and without electron temperature contribution. We conclude that overall the electron pressure effect on the GS reconstruction results contributes to a 10 – 20 % discrepancy in some key physical quantities, such as the magnetic flux content of the ICME flux rope observed at 1 AU." .

The theory allows us to relate the experimental results obtained in such optimal conditions with all the viscoelastic constants characterizing the nematic liquid crystal. Some experimental results are given which show the validity of the theory. They also extend the range of spectral power density measurements of the scattered light down to very low frequency (0.1 Hz) by the use of an oblique-incidence scattering geometry." .

In particular, the Palermo-Harvard model is discussed along with its applications to the detailed fitting of X-ray light curves of solar flares and to the simulation of high-resolution Ca xix spectra in the impulsive phase. These two approaches provide complementary constraints on the relevant features of solar flares. The extension to the stellar case, with the fitting of the light curve of an X-ray flare which occurred on Proxima Centauri, demonstrates the feasibility of using this kind of model for stars too. Although the stellar observations do not provide the wealth of details available for the Sun, and, therefore, constrain the model more loosely, there are strong motivations to pursue this line of research: the wider range of physical parameters in stellar flares and the possibility of studying further the solar-stellar connection." .

The solution is obtained by showing how, by means of a suitable choice of co-ordinates, it is possible to transform the de Sitter universe (solution of the equations of general relativity with cosmological term in the empty space) in the Castelnuovo universe. This latter can be interpreted as the geodesical representation of the de Sitter universe on a flat manifold (extension of Beltrami’s theorem); furthermore, in analogy with Minkowski’s universe, it has some geometrical properties which make the interpretation of the physics of special relativity possible. Finally, by the method followed in this paper, the derivation of a new proof of the theorem of Serini, Einstein and Pauli, Lichnerowitz is made possible as a zero limiting case (i.e. when the cosmological constant tends to zero)." .

The type II bursts were associated with generally weak flares (mostly B and C class soft X-ray flares), but the CMEs were quite energetic. Using CME data for a set of type II bursts during the declining phase of solar cycle 23, we determine the CME height when the type II bursts start, thus giving an estimate of the heliocentric distance at which CME-driven shocks form. This distance has been determined to be ∼1.5R s (solar radii), which coincides with the distance at which the Alfvén speed profile has a minimum value. We also use type II radio observations from STEREO/WAVES and Wind/WAVES observations to show that CMEs with moderate speed drive either weak shocks or no shock at all when they attain a height where the Alfvén speed peaks (∼3R s – 4R s). Thus the shocks seem to be most efficient in accelerating electrons in the heliocentric distance range of 1.5R s to 4R s. By combining the radial variation of the CME speed in the inner corona (CME speed increase) and interplanetary medium (speed decrease) we were able to correctly account for the deviations from the universal drift-rate spectrum of type II bursts, thus confirming the close physical connection between type II bursts and CMEs. The average height (∼1.5R s) of STEREO CMEs at the time of type II bursts is smaller than that (2.2R s) obtained for SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) CMEs. We suggest that this may indicate, at least partly, the density reduction in the corona between the maximum and declining phases, so a given plasma level occurs closer to the Sun in the latter phase. In two cases, there was a diffuse shock-like feature ahead of the main body of the CME, indicating a standoff distance of 1R s – 2R s by the time the CME left the LASCO field of view." .
<http://www.springernature.com/scigraph/things/articles/511d88acbcfa3eba9a3bfbc69dd75aeb> <http://www.springernature.com/scigraph/ontologies/core/abstract> "Abstract The solar wind conditions at one astronomical unit (AU) can be strongly disturbed by interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). A subset, called magnetic clouds (MCs), is formed by twisted flux ropes that transport an important amount of magnetic flux and helicity, which is released in CMEs. At 1 AU from the Sun, the magnetic structure of MCs is generally modeled by neglecting their expansion during the spacecraft crossing. However, in some cases, MCs present a significant expansion. We present here an analysis of the huge and significantly expanding MC observed by the Wind spacecraft during 9 – 10 November 2004. This MC was embedded in an ICME. After determining an approximate orientation for the flux rope using the minimum variance method, we obtain a precise orientation of the cloud axis by relating its front and rear magnetic discontinuities using a direct method. This method takes into account the conservation of the azimuthal magnetic flux between the inbound and outbound branches and is valid for a finite impact parameter (i.e., not necessarily a small distance between the spacecraft trajectory and the cloud axis). The MC is also studied using dynamic models with isotropic expansion. We have found (6.2±1.5)×1020 Mx for the axial flux and (78±18)×1020 Mx for the azimuthal flux. Moreover, using the direct method, we find that the ICME is formed by a flux rope (MC) followed by an extended coherent magnetic region. These observations are interpreted by considering the existence of a previously larger flux rope, which partially reconnected with its environment in the front. We estimate that the reconnection process started close to the Sun. These findings imply that the ejected flux rope is progressively peeled by reconnection and transformed to the observed ICME (with a remnant flux rope in the front part)." .

It is shown that taking into account these functions and integrating over horizontal wave numbers leads to a good agreement with previous observations (Mein, 1977) in the case of 8498 and 8542 Ca ii lines. For the K line, the less good agreement shows that magnetoacoustic waves become important in the upper chromospheric layers." .

Six excitation functions for reactions of the type197Au(α,xn),x=1–3,197Au(α, 2pn) and197Au(α, αxn),x=1–3, were studied, of which five new data points and a new reaction were added to the existing data. The experimental cross-section were compared with the predictions of pre-equilibrium hybrid model, as well as the more recent index model using the initial exciton number,n 0=4(4p0h). It was observed that both models show better agreement in respect of (α,xn)-type reactions. However, they are equally bad for the reactions emitting protons and alpha-particles, and for which some direct reaction contributions are indicated." .

In order to represent the characteristics of the vocal folds and vocal tract during the process of speech production and to explore the physical parameters involved, we propose a method using the two-mass model. As feature parameters, we focus on stiffness parameters of the vocal folds, vocal tract length, and cross-sectional areas of the vocal tract. The stiffness parameters and the area of the entrance to the vocal tract are extracted from the two-mass model after we fit the model to real data using our proposed algorithm. These parameters are related to the velocity of glottal airflow and acoustic interaction between the vocal folds and the vocal tract and can precisely represent features of speech under stress because they are affected by the speaker’s psychological state during speech production. In our experiments, the physical features generated using the proposed approach are compared with traditionally used features, and the results demonstrate a clear improvement of up to 10% to 15% in average stress classification performance, which shows that our proposed method is more effective than conventional methods." .

The use of a rectal probe to measure temperature can be stressful to the subject, especially when used repeatedly. We now present data on the hypothermic effect of ethanol (0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 3.5, or 4.0 g/kg) on surface body temperature in rats as detected by infrared radiation. Ethanol produced significant decreases in nasal temperature that were significantly correlated with changes in rectal temperature. Ethanol (3.5 g/kg) also produced a significant reversal in nasal hypothermia 15 min postinjection that was detected only with the infrared method. This new method is very rapid, accurate, requires minimal handling and may, therefore, be less stressful than rectal measurement to the subject." .

Two main ways of interpreting this phenomenon have been suggested. One of them describes an EIT wave as a fast mode magnetosonic wave freely propagating in the corona. The other interpretation does not consider an EIT wave a true magnetohydrodynamic wave but instead invokes several possibilities linked to the magnetic field restructuring during the coronal mass ejection (CME) evolution in the low corona. We investigate an EIT wave observed by the SECCHI/EUVI telescopes onboard the STEREO spacecraft on 8 December 2007. The wave front had a nearly symmetric shape and exhibited a peculiar velocity profile measured by two independent methods. After an initial short propagation at a speed of around 100 km s−1, the wave was moving at a very low velocity (around 20 – 40 km s−1) for about 30 minutes, and then was reaccelerated up to speeds of around 200 km s−1. It is difficult to envisage such a velocity change for a freely propagating coronal wave. However, such a behavior is possible, for example, for erupting prominences. We conclude that this event provides observational evidence that even EIT waves with a symmetric front can be produced by a magnetic field restructuring during the CME eruption." .

The posterior end of 1- and 2-day-old worms had a central cone-shaped structure not present in 3-day-old and older, or destrobilated worms. The repairing of the posterior end and the protonephridial system after excystation or destrobilation was much the same.

Low potentials are essential for accurate measurements of the thermal plasma. The design of PCD is inherited from instruments for Geotail and Cluster and utilises liquid metal ion sources generating a beam of indium ions at several keV. The set-up of the instrument and its interaction with the plasma instruments on board is presented. When the instrument was switched on during commissioning, unexpectedly high ignition and operating voltages of some ion emitters were observed. An extensive investigation was initiated and the results, which lead to an improved design for Cluster-II, are summarised. The cause of the abnormal behaviour could be linked to surface contamination of some emitters, which will be monitored and cured by on-board procedures in future. The mission operations on Equator-S were not at all affected, because of the high redundancy built into the instrument so that a sufficient number of perfectly operating emitters were available and were turned on routinely throughout the mission. Observations of the effect of spacecraft potential control on the plasma remained limited to just one event on January 8, 1998, which is analysed in detail. It is concluded that the ion beam lead to the predicted improvement of the particle measurements even outside the low density regions of the magnetosphere where the effect of spacecraft potential control would have been much more pronounced, and that the similar instruments for the four Cluster-II spacecraft to be launched in 2000 will be very important to ensure accurate plasma data from this mission." .

The purpose of the time-of-flight measurements is twofold. First, they provide the drift velocity, and thus the electric field, when the distance the electrons drift in a gyro period becomes sufficiently large. Second, they provide the gyro time of the electrons emitted by the instrument, and thus the magnitude of the ambient magnetic field, allowing in-flight calibration of the flux-gate magnetometer with high precision.

Three classes of mechanosensitive ion channels were present and could be distinguished on the basis of conductance, ionic selectivity, and sensitivity to membrane tension. The largest conductance channel (160 pS) was K+-selective and showed both a decrease in long closed interval duration and an increase in burst length with increasing membrane tension. For low applied pressures, there was an e-fold increase in the probability of this channel being open (P open) for every 3.4 cm2 Hg change in pressure. Two additional pressure-dependent channels had smaller conductances, i.e., 60 pS and 20 pS; the 60 pS channel appeared to be non-selective for cations. We propose that one or more of these mechano-sensitive channels is involved in the response of bone to mechanical loading." .

In recent papers, double parton correlations have been studied in the valence quark region, by means of constituent quark models. This framework allows to understand clearly the dynamical origin of the correlations and to establish which, among the features of the results, are model independent. Recent relevant results, obtained in a relativistic light-front scheme, able to overcome some drawbacks of previous calculations, such as the poor support, will be presented. Peculiar transverse momentum correlations, generated by the correct treatment of the boosts, are obtained. The role of spin correlations will be also shown. In this covariant approach, the symmetries of the dPDFs are unambiguously reproduced. The study of the QCD evolution of the model results has been performed in the valence sector, showing that, in some cases, the effect of evolution does not cancel that of correlations." .

The science objectives of this mission are to: (1) globally map the elemental composition of the surface, (2) determine the abundance of hydrogen in the shallow subsurface, (3) acquire high spatial and spectral resolution images of the surface mineralogy, (4) provide information on the morphology of the surface, and (5) characterize the Martian near-space radiation environment as related to radiation-induced risk to human explorers. To accomplish these objectives, the 2001 Mars Odyssey science payload includes a Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS), a multi-spectral Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS), and a radiation detector, the Martian Radiation Environment Experiment (MARIE). THEMIS and MARIE are mounted on the spacecraft with THEMIS pointed at nadir. GRS is a suite of three instruments: a Gamma Subsystem (GSS), a Neutron Spectrometer (NS) and a High-Energy Neutron Detector (HEND). The HEND and NS instruments are mounted on the spacecraft body while the GSS is on a 6-m boom. Some science data were collected during the cruise and aerobraking phases of the mission before the prime mission started. THEMIS acquired infrared and visible images of the Earth-Moon system and of the southern hemisphere of Mars. MARIE monitored the radiation environment during cruise. The GRS collected calibration data during cruise and aerobraking. Early GRS observations in Mars orbit indicated a hydrogen-rich layer in the upper meter of the subsurface in the Southern Hemisphere. Also, atmospheric densities, scale heights, temperatures, and pressures were observed by spacecraft accelerometers during aerobraking as the spacecraft skimmed the upper portions of the Martian atmosphere. This provided the first in-situ evidence of winter polar warming in the Mars upper atmosphere. The prime mission for 2001 Mars Odyssey began in February 2002 and will continue until August 2004. During this prime mission, the 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft will also provide radio relays for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and European landers in early 2004. Science data from 2001 Mars Odyssey instruments will be provided to the science community via NASA’s Planetary Data System (PDS). The first PDS release of Odyssey data was in October 2002; subsequent releases occur every 3 months." .

In order to fit the small gap (5 mm) of magnetic structure and vacuum environment, a small three-dimensional Hall probe has been manufactured. The angular and positional misalignment errors of the Hall sensors play an important role in the measurement accuracy of the CPMU. In order to minimize the misalignment errors, a method of calibrating angle error and relative assembly displacements of a three-dimensional Hall probe is carried out. MethodsThe angle error of Hall sensors will be calibrated by a standard dipole magnet and a five-dimensional Hall bench. The standard dipole magnet will generate a single direction and uniform magnetic field. And the five-dimensional Hall bench is used to rotate the Hall probe which is put in the center of magnet. Based on the relationship between angle and magnetic field strength, the angle error of each Hall sensor will be obtained. The relative position between the sensitive areas of the Hall sensors will be calibrated by a two-dimensional magnetic field undulator section. Based on Maxwell’s equations, through the calculation of measurement magnetic field strength, the relative assembly displacements of the three Hall sensors can be derived. ResultsThe details of the calibration methods and the data processing of angle error and relative assembly displacements of a three-dimensional Hall probe are presented. The three-dimensional magnetic fields of a cryogenic permanent magnet undulator can be received accurately by correcting these angle errors and position errors of Hall sensors. ConclusionsThis paper illustrates the relative position and angle calibration procedures and the data processing of a three-dimensional Hall probe. Now the design of a smaller Hall probe is in process. The calibration of the angle errors and position errors will be carried out after the fabrication of the standard dipole magnet." .

In the experiment a collinear pair of panoramic annular lenses and an ion laser are used to illuminate and observe the inner walls of a circular pipe. A holographic image is obtained in the shape of an annulus showing the entire surround of the lenses. To produce the holointerferogram, a carrier is introduced by translating the pipe axially, and a line load is applied parallel to the system axis. The interference pattern of the carrier and deformation is then recorded with a CCD. This pattern is linearized by applying a two-dimensional mapping to correct the distortions introduced by the panoramic optical system and then the linearized pattern is analyzed in the usual way (phase mapping, carrier subtraction, phase unwrapping). The experimental results are excellent and demonstrate the unique value of panoramic annular lenses in making precision deformation mappings of the interior surface of pipes or cylinders." .

Measurement of the standard deviation σ AA of these fluctuations, in a direction perpendicular to the solar limb, provides sufficient information to estimate an absolute parameter characterizing the seeing, i.e. Fried's parameter r 0 or the equivalent parameter ∫ L C N 2(h) dh which gives the integral, over an atmosphere thickness L which depends on the spatial and angular filterings performed by the slit, of the structure constant C N2characterizing fluctuations in the air's refractive index. Simultaneous estimations of σ AA 2 and ∫ L C N 2(h) dh permit a linear relationship to be established between these two quantities. The result is interpreted theoretically by integration of the two-dimensional power spectrum for the angle-of-arrival fluctuations. The influence of filtering effects is discussed. Such a calibration can be performed for a given telescope and slit, enabling the system to be used as a seeing monitor." .

It is also shown that during magnetic storms, the energy of the ring current quantified with Dst increases in proportion to L e −3, where L e is the L-value corresponding to the equatorward boundary of the auroral belt designated by the auroral boundary index. This means that the ring current energy is proportional to the ion energy obtained from the earthward shift of the plasma sheet under the conservation of the first adiabatic invariant. The ring current energy is also pronortional to E mag , the total magnetic field energy contained in the spherical shell bounded by L e and L eq , where L eq corresponds to the quiet-time location of the auroral precipitation boundary. The ratio of the ring current energy E R to the dipole energy E mag is typically 10%. The ring current leads to magnetosphere inflation as a result of an increase in the equivalent dipole moment." .

The SF6 molecules captured by (CO2) N clusters in crossed cluster and molecular beams sublimate (evaporate) after a certain time, carrying information about the cluster velocity and internal temperature. Experiments are performed using detection of these molecules with an uncooled pyroelectric detector and infrared multiphoton excitation. The multiphoton absorption spectra of molecules sublimating from clusters are compared with the IR multiphoton absorption spectra of SF6 in the incoming beam. As a result, the nanoparticle temperature in the (CO2) N cluster beam is estimated as T cl < 150 K. Time-of-flight measurements using a pyroelectric detector and a pulsed CO2 laser are performed to determine the velocity (kinetic energy) of SF6 molecules sublimating from clusters, and the cluster temperature is found to be T cl = 105 ± 15 K. The effects of various factors on the results of nanoparticle temperature measurements are analyzed. The potential use of the proposed technique for vibrational cooling of molecules to low temperatures is discussed." .

The results show that such fields have a minor effect on the C–N or C–H bond but a major effect on the N–O bond in CH3NO2, while in NH2NO2 electric fields affect the N–N bond greatly but the N–O or N–H bond only slightly. Thus, in CH3NO2, oxygen transfer or unimolecular isomerization to methyl nitrite might precede breaking of the C–N bond in the initial stages of decomposition, and the N–O bond could be the trigger bond in electric fields. In NH2NO2, however, N–N bond rupture may be preferential in an electric field and, consequently, the N–N bond might always be the real trigger bond. Atoms in molecules and natural bond orbital delocalization analyses, together with examination of shifts in electron density and frequencies support the above viewpoints. Forty-eight good linear correlations were found along the different field orientations at different levels of theory, including those between field strength (E) and changes in N−O/N−N bond length (ΔR N−O/N−N), ρ (N−O/N−N) values [Δρ (N−O/N−N), or stretching frequencies of the N−O/N−N bond (ΔυN−O/N−N).

These reactions are then applied to the negative-ion chemistry following the injection of an electron cloud of very high density, of the order of 106-107 e- cm−3, in the 40-45-km region. The idea is to evaluate the recently proposed scheme to mitigate ozone depletion by converting the reactive chlorine atoms at these altitudes into Cl- ions which are unreactive towards ozone, i.e., electron scavenging of Cl. We find that the previously neglected photodetachment from Cl- is fast. For an overhead sun, this process may have a rate coefficient of 0.08 s−1 when multiple scattering is included. The rate could be even higher, depending on the ground albedo. Switching reaction between Cl-·H2O and HCl might lead to the formation of Cl-·HCl anion. Possible reactions of Cl-·H2O and Cl-·HCl with O atoms could produce ClO- and Cl-2. The production of ClO- in this manner is significant because Cl- having a high photodetachment rate constant would be regenerated in the very likely reactions of ClO- with O. When these possibilities are considered, then it is found that the chlorine anions may not be the major ions inside the electron cloud due to the rapid photodetachment from Cl-. Furthermore, in such a cloud, there may be the hazard that the Cl--Cl-·H2O-ClO--Cl- cycle amounts to catalytic destruction of two O atoms. Thus, the scheme could be risky if practised in the altitude region where atomic oxygen is an important constituent. Similar conclusions apply even if the ClO- species forms ClO-3 by three-body association with O2, instead of reacting with O. It must be emphasized that the present study is speculative at this time, because none of the relevant reactions have been investigated in the laboratory as yet. Nevertheless, it is very safe to say that the scheme of ozone preservation by electron scavenging of the upper stratospheric Cl is much less certain than implied in the studies reported by its original proponents, because those studies neglected the photodetachment from Cl- and made the highly unlikely assumption that the Cl-·H2O anion neither photodissociates nor reacts any further. The situation at the lower altitudes could be even more complex due to the formation of large cluster ions and the ion-induced aerosol formation. The lower atmospheric situation, therefore, requires much more study. The uncertainties in the scavenging scheme due to the electrostatic repulsion in the cloud should also be addressed. Despite the uncertainties about its environmental engineering usefulness, the emerging technology for artificial creation of plasmas, with any desired density and charge in the stratosphere, could have significant pure scientific values in the studies of stratospheric ion chemistry and ion-induced aerosol formation. Such studies have perennially suffered from the extremely low densities of the naturally occurring plasma." .

It is suggested that these mirrors, fixed at constant radius but effectively moving, are important in production of cosmic rays, and it is shown that the appropriate constants relating to the mirrors are compatible with a Fermi accelerator mechanism of first order dependence on effective mirror velocity.

Inherent to this assumption is the premise that the ion stage densities are determined solely by atomic processes which are local functions of the plasma temperature and electron density. However, if the time scale of plasma flow through a temperature gradient is less than the characteristic time scale for an important atomic process, deviations from the ionization stage densities expected for equilibrium will occur which could introduce serious errors into subsequent analyses. In the past few years, significant flow velocities in the upper solar atmosphere have been inferred from observations of emission lines originaing in the transition region (about 104–106 K) and corona. In this paper, three models of the solar atmosphere (quiet Sun, coronal hole, and a network model) are examined to determine if the emission expected from these model atmospheres could be produced from equilibrium ion populations when steady flows of several kilometers per second are assumed. If the flows are quasi-periodic instead of steady, spatial and temporal averaging inherent in the observations may allow for the construction of satisfactory models based on the assumption of ionization equilibrium. Representative emission lines are analysed for the following ions: C iii, iv, O iv, v, vi, Ne vii, viii, Mg ix, x, Si xii, and Fe ix–xiv. Two principle conclusions are drawn. First, only the iron ions are generally in equilibrium for steady flows of 20 km s−1. For carbon and oxygen, ionization equilibrium is not a valid assumption for steady flows as small as 1 km s−1. Second, the three models representing different solar conditions behave in a qualitatively similar manner, implying that these results are not particularly model dependent over the range of temperature gradients and electron densities thus far inferred for the Sun. In view of the flow velocities which have been reported for the Sun, our results strongly suggest caution in using the assumption of ionization equilibrium for interpreting spectral lines produced in the transition region." .

Consequently colorful SWCNTs on substrates can be directly imaged under an optical microscope by wide field supercontinuum laser illumination, which facilitates high throughput chirality assignment of individual SWCNTs. This approach, termed “Rayleigh imaging microscopy”, is not restricted to SWCNTs, but widely applicable to a variety of nanomaterials, which enables the colorful nanoworld to be explored under optical microscopes.

Hydrodynamic plasma flows during flares arise due to fast energy release which is accumulated in the magnetic field of currents in the solar atmosphere. Shock waves arise as a result of rapid heating of the chromospheric upper layers from accelerated particles or heat fluxes. Powerful hydrodynamic phenomena can also arise due to explosive current sheet disruption in the region of strong magnetic field reconnection. Fundamental questions of shock wave formation and propagation in a non-homogeneous emitting solar atmosphere are discussed." .

When two regions of opposite polarity come into contact with each other, ions drifting in response to the Lorentz force fall into the minimum of the magnetic field, and then the drifting ions force the neutrals to take part in the flow. Because of the finite time required for ion-atom collisions to occur, the gas which emerges from the interaction site has an ion/atom ratio which may be altered relative to that in the ambient medium. In order to model this effect, we adapt the Zeus code to a two-step iterative process involving a cycle between the hydrodynamic (HD) and the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) versions of the code. The ion and atom fluids are coupled by collisions. Our simulations show that in chromospheric conditions, outflowing gas exhibits enhancements in ion/atom ratios which may be as large as a factor of 10 or more. The magnitude of the enhancements is determined by two key ratios which enter into the problem: the degree of ionization (ni/na), and the plasma β parameter. We show that, in the context of the mechanism we propose here, the amplitude of the ion/atom enhancements in the solar chromosphere is subject to a remarkable self-regulation because the ion density ni is almost invariant over the height range of interest to us. Our results are relevant in the context of the Sun, where the coronal abundances of elements with low first ionization potential (FIP) are systematically enhanced in certain magnetic structures. Although data for stars other than the Sun are sparse, we point out that our results are also useful for interpreting the available stellar data." .

When estimating rate constants using the BIAcore surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor, one must have an accurate mathematical model to interpret sensogram data. Several models of differing complexity are discussed, including the effective rate constant (ERC) approach. This model can be shown formally to be good within O(Da) in the limit of small Damköhler number Da, which is the ratio of the reaction rate to the rate of transport to the surface. Numerical results are presented that show that except for very slow reactions, parameter estimates from the ERC model are very close to those estimated using a more complicated model. The BIAcore measures the behavior of an evanescent wave whose signal strength decays as it penetrates into the device. It is shown that this decay does not appreciably affect the sensogram readout at low Da, but at moderate Da can lead to situations where two vastly different rate constants can produce the same short-time sensogram data." .

In contrast to low-resolution magnetograph observations which measure the polar magnetic field averaged over a large area, we focused our efforts on the properties of the small magnetic elements in the polar region. Evolution of the filling factor - the ratio of the area occupied by the magnetic elements to the total area - of these magnetic elements, as well as the average magnetic field strength, were studied during the maximum and declining phase of solar cycle 22, from early 1991 to mid-1993. We found that during the sunspot maximum period, the polar regions were occupied by about equal numbers of positive and negative magnetic elements, with equal average field strength. As the solar cycle progresses toward sunspot minimum, the magnetic field elements in the polar region become predominantly of one polarity. The average magnetic field of the dominant polarity elements also increases with the filling factor. In the meanwhile, both the filling factor and the average field strength of the non-dominant polarity elements decrease. The combined effects of the changing filling factors and average field strength produce the observed evolution of the integrated polar flux over the solar cycle. We compared the evolutionary histories of both filling factor and average field strength, for regions of high (70°–80°) and low (60°–70°) latitudes. For the south pole, we found no significant evidence of difference in the time of reversal. However, the low-latitude region of the north pole did reverse polarity much earlier than the high-latitude region. It later showed an oscillatory behavior. We suggest this may be caused by the poleward migration of flux from a large active region in 1989 with highly imbalanced flux." .

The conductivity of the system depends on three characteristic times: τ1(τ2) is determined by the fermion (boson) impurity scattering and τ12 is determined by the friction between the subsystems; the respective temperature dependences are obtained. The conductivity is related to the relaxation time τ in the usual way, and τ obeys the relationship τ−1=τ 1−1+(τ2+τ12)−1. It follows from the results obtained that the resistivity of pure samples should increase with temperature and tend towards saturation." .

In accordance with this concept, we have proposed a fundamental structure of detecting side scattered light from a minute cell or particle running along a microfluidic channel, partially utilizing the channel filled with water or saline solution as a light waveguide. Based on this concept, we have fabricated a trial-manufactured optical TAS chip and carefully evaluated its side scattered light measuring performance in in-plane direction, supplying and detecting visible laser power by using multiple optical fibers and their precise positioning mechanisms. We have successfully obtained experimental results of both transmitted light power change and that of side scattered light, and we confirmed that there was a strong relationship between their signal waveforms. Furthermore, we have developed a hybrid numerical calculation method on the basis of the finite-difference time-domain method, in addition to the beam propagation method. Based on this hybrid method, we tried to compare results between the experimental inverse pulse of transmitted light and a pulse of side scattered light, and those based on numerical calculations. Excellent qualitative accordance was obtained between the inverse pulse of numerical and experimental results. In contrast, the experimental pulse of side scattered light indicated a considerably spread base in comparison to the numerical results." .

At the center-side penumbra, with a line-of-sight Evershed outflow of 1.5 km s−1, a persistent patch, somewhat darker than the average penumbra, has a LOS velocity of 1.3 km s−1 in opposite direction, probably a downflow. At the limb-side penumbra, a photosphere-like area is interspersed, interrupting the Evershed flow which resumes with typical strength beyond this feature towards the outer penumbral boundary.

Analysis of the HXR time profiles in different energy channels made with the Lomb periodogram has indicated two statistically significant time periods of about 16 and 36 s. The 36 s QPP were observed only in the nonthermal HXR emission in the impulsive phase of the flare. The 16 s QPP were found in thermal and nonthermal HXR emission both in the impulsive and in the decay phases of the flare. Imaging analysis of the flare region, the determined time periods of the QPP, and the estimated physical parameters of the flare loops allowed us to interpret the observed QPP in terms of MHD oscillations excited in two spatially separated, but interacting systems of flaring loops." .

Ideally, the simulated trajectories should capture “fast” (picosecond) snapshots of spin-probe rotations accurately, while being lengthy enough to ensure a proper Fourier integration of the time-domain signal. It is the interplay of the two criteria that poses computational challenges to the method. In this context, an analysis of the spin-probe and protein conformational sampling and equilibration, with different force fields and with explicit solvent, may be a useful attempt. The present work reports a comparative study of the effect of the molecular dynamics (MD) force field on conformational sampling and equilibration in two spin-labeled T4 lysozyme (T4L) variants, N40C and K48C. Ensembles of 10× 3 ns-trajectories per variant and per force field (OPLS/AMBER and AMBER99) are analyzed for a reliable assessment of convergence and sampling. It is found that subtle site-dependent differences in spin-probe rotations and torsions are more readily captured in the AMBER99 trajectories than in the OPLS/AMBER simulations. On the other hand, sampling and equilibration are found to be better with the OPLS/AMBER force field at equal trajectory lengths.

The results were obtained in a group of 13 players of the national representative team (age 24.4 years), and in 1 goaler. In the players we also followed the physical fitness by means of a loading experiment on bicycle ergometer in the middle of the racing season, and before the opening of the World Championship 1971. The principial results are as follows: the energy expenditure during the play is 0.48 kcal/min·kg (3137% BMR), the oxygen debt 6.3 1. The anaerobic part of the metabolism is approximately two thirds of the total energy expenditure. The average heart rate during the activity on ice was 152 beats per minute, the pulmonary ventilation 92 1, the oxygen uptake 32 ml/min·kg. During one turn (1.17 min) the players covered the distance 285 m. The comparison of maximum values of the indices obtained by ergometrical examination in two examinations did not show any substancial differences. We can assume that the decrease observed in several indices may have been caused by a low motivation at loading up to the maximum (the lactic acid, pulmonary ventilation, oxygen uptake). Other findings (the fat percentage increment) can be explained by a less intensive training, unbalance between performance and nutrition. A relatively independent index is the W 170 which has shown the unchanged level of cardiorespiratory functions. From the results various conclusions can be drawn for the work of trainers. The ice-hockey proves to be an activity with mostly submaximal metabolic rate, where appears a great part of anaerobic metabolism simultaneously with high requirements for the aerobic metabolism. For the training practice the requirements follow to intensify the interval training, to increase the play intensity in the training, to use the necessary number of play exercises requiring the typical anaerobic power, and to load the players, in the preparatory period, more often by endurance activities for the aerobic endurance be developed." .

It is unfortunate that many observed features of solar flares and substorms have tacitly been ascribed to unproven (3-D) characteristics of the neutral line for a long time.

Because the coupling and the capsulating processes are triggered only when heterogeneous quantum dots floating in a solution closely approach each other to induce optical near-field interactions between them, the distances between the coupled quantum dots are physically guaranteed to be equal to the scale of the optical near fields. To experimentally verify our idea, we fabricated coupled quantum dots, consisting of CdSe and ZnO quantum dots and a UV-curable polymer.

The compliance of the walls affects the first resonance and almost does not affect the higher-order resonances. The presence of branching in the tract at the level of the larynx affects the second and third resonances stronger than the first resonance. The parameters of the wall impedance (the loss, mass, and elasticity) and the length and cross-sectional area of the branchings are determined by minimizing the rms discrepancy between the measured and calculated resonance frequencies. The error in the frequency calculation with allowance for the wall compliance and branching in the tract proves to be within the accuracy of the formant estimation." .

Specific absorption rate (SAR) is the most frequently used parameter for monitoring and quantifying the power deposition on a subject during an MRI examination. The peak-to-average SAR ratio is important information for the MRI operator during the acquisition sequence setup. In this work, a birdcage body coil model is used for RF excitation of several inhomogeneous human thorax models with different sizes and weights. To study the peak-to-average SAR ratio correlation with sample metrics, numerical simulations using the finite difference time domain method were performed to estimate the peak and average SAR values on the entire sample volume. Results for 11 different thorax models indicate a strong correlation between the peak-to-average SAR value and the sample metrics." .

A method has been developed for the determination of Pb in coal using direct solid sampling (SS) and high-resolution continuum source graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (HR-CS GF AAS). The certified coal reference materials used in this study were ground in an agate mortar to particle size ≤50 µm. Mass aliquots between 0.1 and 1 mg were weighed onto pyrolytic graphite platforms, and inserted directly into the graphite tube. For pyrolysis temperatures lower than 600 °C, a continuous background due to radiation scattering at solid particles preceded the atomic signal, as the coal matrix could not be sufficiently eliminated under these conditions. An optimized pyrolysis temperature of 700 °C was adopted for Pb without the use of a modifier. The optimum atomization temperature was found to be 1700 °C. Under these conditions, interference-free determination could be performed with calibration against aqueous standards in 0.5% v/v HNO3. A total of six certified reference coal samples were analyzed, and the results obtained were all in good agreement with certified and informed values, respectively, according to a Student t-test at a 95% confidence level. A detection limit of 0.008 µg g−1 for Pb was obtained at the 217.000 nm resonance line, a value comparable to those obtained by other sensitive, but much more sophisticated techniques, showing that the absence of dilution in the SS-HR-CS GF AAS method allows at least equivalent detection performance." .

Algorithms are developed from the analysis of small X-ray flares occurring during the deep solar minimum of 2009, between Solar Cycles 23 and 24, observed by the Polish Solar Photometer in X-rays (SphinX) on the Complex Orbital Observations Near-Earth of Activity of the Sun-Photon (CORONAS-Photon) spacecraft. One is a semi-automatic flare detection procedure that gives start, peak, and end times for single (“elementary”) flare events under the assumption that the light curve is a simple convolution of a Gaussian and exponential decay functions. More complex flares with multiple peaks can generally be described by a sum of such elementary flares. Flare time profiles in the two energy ranges of SphinX (1.16 – 1.51 keV, 1.51 – 15 keV) are used to derive temperature and emission measure as a function of time during each flare. The result is a comprehensive catalogue – the SphinX Flare Catalogue – which contains 1600 flares or flare-like events and is made available for general use. The methods described here can be applied to observations made by Geosynchronous Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) and other broad-band spectrometers." .

We study non-adiabatic transitions in scattering theory for the timedependent molecular Schrödinger equation in the Born-Oppenheimer limit. We assume the electron Hamiltonian has finitely many levels and consider the propagation of coherent states with high enough total energy. When two of the electronic levels are isolated from the rest of the electron Hamiltonian’s spectrum and display an avoided crossing, we compute the component of the nuclear wave function associated with the non-adiabatic transition that is generated by propagation through the avoided crossing. This component is shown to be exponentially small in the square of the Born-Oppenheimer parameter, due to the Landau-Zener mechanism. It propagates asymptotically as a free Gaussian in the nuclear variables, and its momentum is shifted. The total transition probability for this transition and the momentum shift are both larger than what one would expect from a naive approximation and energy conservation.

Decomposing the scalar field into a mean-field part and fluctuations we obtain spontaneous pair creation driven by a self-interacting strong background field. The produced fermion and boson pairs are self-consistently coupled. Consequently back reactions arise from fermion and boson currents determining the time-dependent self-interacting background mean field. We explore the numerical solution with cylindric boundary conditions for the time evolution of the mean field as well as for the number- and energy densities for fermions and bosons. We find that after a characteristic time all energy is converted from the background mean field to particle creation. Applying this general approach to the production of “quarks” and “gluons” a typical time scale for the collapse of the flux tube is 1.5 fm/c." .

Here, the sensitive thermodynamic technique isothermal titration calorimetry was used to study the energetics of Cu(II) binding to DAHK and GHK peptides in the presence of the weaker ligand glycine as a competitor. DAHK and GHK bind Cu(II) predominantly in a 1:1 stoichiometry with conditional dissociation constants [i.e., at pH 7.4, in the absence of the competing chelators glycine and 2-(4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethanesulfonic acid buffer] of 2.6 ± 0.4 × 10−14 M and 7.0 ± 1.0 × 10−14 M, respectively. Furthermore, the apparent ΔH values were measured and the number of protons released upon Cu(II) binding was determined by performing experiments in different buffers. This allowed us to determine the conditional ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS, i.e., corrected for the contributions of the weaker ligand glycine and the buffer at pH 7.4. We found that the entropic and enthalpic contributions to the Cu(II) binding to GHK and DAHK are distinct, with a enthalpic contribution for GHK. The thermodynamic parameters obtained correspond well to those in the literature obtained by other techniques, suggesting that the use of the weaker ligand glycine as a competitor in isothermal titration calorimetry provides accurate data for Cu(II) binding to high-affinity peptides, which cannot be accurately determined without the use of a competitor ligand." .

The most relevant were non-local contact predictions for targets from the most difficult categories: fold recognition-analogy and new fold. Such contacts could provide valuable structural information in case a template structure cannot be found in the PDB. ResultsWe described comprehensive tests of the effectiveness of contact data in various aspects of de novo modeling with CABS, an algorithm which was used successfully in CASP6 by the Kolinski-Bujnicki group. We used the predicted contacts in a simple scoring function for the post-simulation ranking of protein models and as a soft bias in the folding simulations and in the fold-refinement procedure. The latter approach turned out to be the most successful. The CABS force field used in the Replica Exchange Monte Carlo simulations cooperated with the true contacts and discriminated the false ones, which resulted in an improvement of the majority of Kolinski-Bujnicki's protein models. In the modeling we tested different sets of predicted contact data submitted to the CASP6 server. According to our results, the best performing were the contacts with the accuracy balanced with the coverage, obtained either from the best two predictors only or by a consensus from as many predictors as possible. ConclusionOur tests have shown that theoretically predicted contacts can be very beneficial for protein structure prediction. Depending on the protein modeling method, a contact data set applied should be prepared with differently balanced coverage and accuracy of predicted contacts. Namely, high coverage of contact data is important for the model ranking and high accuracy for the folding simulations." .

The load-dependent model we developed corresponds to common friction systems, where the friction couples are sliding under fixed load for various speeds. Here, we study the effect of the sliding speed on the contact distance between two contacting bodies. In accordance with experimental observations and theoretical arguments, we find the contact distance increased with the sliding speed. We show that the dependence of the reaction force on sliding speed can be rationalized by assuming that the frequency dependence of the polymer chains relaxation times is affected by the damping effects of contact stress. By investigating the energy dissipation, we show how the friction coefficient is affected by the sliding speed. The deformation volume and relaxation times decreased with the increasing sliding speed, which result in the decreasing of energy dissipation. Then, the work in pushing the top cylinder across the bottom plateau decreases, results in a reduction of the mean horizontal reaction force and friction coefficient." .

After incubation for 1 h, a striking difference in the electrophoretic pattern of newly synthesized labelled poly(A)+ RNA and the poly(A)+ RNA present in sufficient amounts for optical density measurements (steady state poly(A)+ RNA) was observed. During early and mid-oogenesis, in the poly(A)− RNA fraction, ≧4S predominantly mature rRNA, 5S RNA and tRNA were labelled. These fractions were no longer synthesized during late oogenesis, whereas poly(A)+ RNA was labelled continously During oogenesis stage specific differences in the size distribution of newly synthesized and steady state poly(A)+ RNA were not obvious. However, different sizes of labelled poly(A)+ RNA species were detected in 0–2h old preblastoderm embryos, after injection of3H-uridine into females either 3–4 days (stage 3–4 of oogenesis) or 24 h before oviposition (stage 5–6 of oogenesis). This difference in RNA synthesis was related to the presence of active nurse cell nuclei. The poly(A)+ RNA fraction represents about 2–3% of the total RNA in both ovaries and freshly laid eggs as judged by measurements of optical density and radioactivity bound to oligo(dT). The length of poly(A)-segments in ovarian poly(A)+ RNA varied from about 30 to 200 nucleotides." .

Some basic properties of the PMF are described as they relate to ULF hydromagnetic waves in the magnetosphere. Examples are given of recent results obtained using both analytical and numerical techniques for waves from the lowest frequencies (determined by the dimensions of the magnetosphere) up to the vicinity of the ion cyclotron frequency. These results include the possibilities that the PMF may transport plasma over large distances in the magnetosphere, and that the PMF may energize magnetospheric ions significantly. In particular the PMF may play a role in transporting and energizing O+ ions from the ionosphere into the body of the magnetosphere. The PMF can also generate nonlinear coupling between the slow magnetosonic mode and the other hydromagnetic modes. This should lead to limitation of density enhancements and, notably in the case of standing Alfvén waves, to spatial harmonic generation, secularly growing frequency shifts, and saturation of driven wave fields. Some implications of these results for the magnetosphere are discussed." .

For then=2, 2′ excitons a reasonable value ranging between the radius of then=2 exciton and the nearest neighbour distance is obtained.

Calculation of matrix elements of two body interactions needed in the hyperspherical harmonics expansion method for a three body system is greatly simplified by expanding the bra- and ket-vector states in the hyperspherical harmonics (HH) basis states appropriate for the partition corresponding to the interacting pair. This involves the Raynal–Revai coefficients (RRC), which are the transformation coefficients between the HH bases corresponding to the two partitions. Use of RRC become particularly essential for the numerical solution of three-body Schrődinger equation where the two-body potentials are other than Coulomb or harmonic. However in the present work the technique is used for two electron atoms 1H−(p + e − e −), D−(d + e − e −), Mu−(μ + e − e −),4He(4 He 2+ e − e −),6Li(6 Li 3+ e − e −),10Be(10 Be 4+ e − e −),12C(12 C 6+ e − e −),16O(16 O 8+ e − e −) etc. and the exotic positronium negative ion Ps −(e + e − e −) where the interactions are purely Coulomb. The relative convergence in ground state binding energy with increasing K max for 20Ne has been demonstrated as a representative case. The calculated energies at K max  = 28 using RRC’s have been compared with those obtained by a straight forward manner in some representative cases to demonstrate the appropriateness of the use of RRC. The extrapolated energies have also been compared with those found in the literature. The calculated binding energies agree within the computational error." .

As the walls of real resonators are not perfectly rigid, some perturbations occur in the frequency range of the acoustic resonances measured within helium gas contained in the cavity. As a contribution for a better understanding of this phenomenon, an experiment to measure the shell modes of the spherical resonators is in use in this laboratory. A work in progress to assess these modes using a hammer blow method together with modal analysis is reported here. The study is carried out with an air-filled, copper-walled, half-liter quasi-spherical resonator in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 20 kHz. Results show that the shell modes expand into multiple resonances of similar modal shape, including the “breathing” mode.

The Alfvén-Lawson limit on an electric current implies some severe limitations including the following: the current flowing into the corona cannot exceed about 1012 A; if the current density is near threshold for a current instability then the current must flow in thin layers; and, the primary electrons and ions cannot be accelerated simply by the particles falling down a parallel potential drop. Considerable progress has been made in understanding how electron beams in type III solar radio events propagate in a way that is consistent with the generation of Langmuir waves, but a completely consistent picture has not yet emerged. Such beams, and more importantly the electron beams that generate hard X-ray bursts require current neutralization; how the required return current is set up is still not entirely clear. There is direct evidence for ion beams with energies ≳ 10 MeV per nucleon from γ-ray line emission; there is no unambiguous evidence for ion beams of lower energy. A mechanism is suggested for bulk energization of electrons due to dissipation of a parallel current in solar flares. Some outstanding problems concerning particle beams are identified." .

These observations have been interpreted to yield important physical parameters of the solar corona and the dynamical processes around 2R ⊙ from the photosphere where transition from closed to open field lines takes places and the solar wind builds up. The decametric noise bursts have been classified into (i) ‘BF’ type bursts which show variation of intensity with frequency and time and (ii) decametric type III bursts. The angular sizes of noise storm sources taking into account refraction and scattering effects are discussed. An attempt has been made to give phenomenology of all the known varieties of decametric bursts in this review. Available polarization information of decametric continuum and bursts has been summarized. Recent simultaneous satellite and ground-based observations of decametric solar bursts show that their intensities are deeply modulated by scintillations in the Earth's ionosphere. Salient features of various models and theories of the metric and decametric noise storms proposed so far are examined and a more satisfactory model is suggested which explains the ‘BF’ type bursts as well as conventional noise storm bursts at decametric wavelengths invoking induced scattering process for 1 → t conversion. Some suggestions for further solar decametric studies from the ground-based and satellite-borne experiments have been made." .

The MDI power spectra were corrected with Gaussian Modulation Transfer Function. We obtained reliable magnetic power spectra in the high wave numbers range, up to k=4.6 Mm−1, which corresponds to a spatial scale l=1.4 Mm. We find that the occurrence of the spectral discontinuity at high wave numbers, k≥3 Mm−1, largely depends on the spatial resolution of the data and it appears at progressively higher wave numbers as the resolution of the data improves. The spectral discontinuity in the raw spectra is located at wave numbers about 3 times smaller than wave numbers, corresponding to the resolution of the data, and about 1.5–2.0 times smaller in the case of the noise- and-resolution corrected spectra. The magnetic power spectra for active and quiet regions are different: active-region power spectra are described as ∼k −1.7, while in a quiet region the spectrum behaves as ∼k −1.3. We suggest that the difference can be due to small-scale dynamo action in the quiet-Sun photosphere. Our estimations show that the dynamo can generate more than 6% of the observed magnetic power." .

Both circulations show a distinctive layered vertical wind and temperature structure. Westerly down-valley flow is typically neutral and is characterised by strong surface winds overlain by light variable winds extending to an inversion between 2000 and 4000m in depth. Above this inversion, gradient winds prevail. This structure is similar to that of downslope winds observed elsewhere. The thermally-induced up-valley easterly flow is shown to be extremely well-developed in terms of its strength, depth and persistence. The strong surface easterly may reach 800 m in depth and usually undercuts the warmer westerly. The boundary between the two regimes is marked by an inversion. During easterly flow a surface-based, super-adiabatic layer of 100–200 m in depth is evident and is associated with weak convective activity. An intriguing aspect of the wind regime is the interaction between the easterly and westerly circulations in the valley. These are separated at the surface by a frontal zone which migrates up and down the valley. Further observational and modelling studies are recommended." .

We study the double-diffractive production of various heavy systems (e.g. Higgs, dijet, $t\\bar{t}$ and SUSY particles) at LHC and Tevatron collider energies.

We calculate both the luminosity for different production mechanisms, and a wide variety of subprocess cross sections. The results allow numerical predictions to be readily made for the cross sections of all these processes at the LHC and the Tevatron collider. For example, we predict that the cross section for the exclusive double-diffractive production of a 120 GeV Higgs boson at the LHC is about 3 fb, and that the QCD background in the $b\\bar{b}$ decay mode is about 4 times smaller than the Higgs signal if the experimental missing-mass resolution is 1 GeV.

We consider different initial locations of the wave function of the c.m. of the molecule: inside the trapping potential, outside the trap, and partly inside and partly outside. We also examine for each initial location the motion for a range of initial speeds of the c.m. relative to the trap. We calculate the probability that the molecule ends up trapped inside the potential well as well as the probabilities that the molecule will escape the trap by tunneling past or reflecting off the trapping potential. We also reveal the intermediary behavior of the motion, including oscillations in time of the position of the c.m., especially near the edges of the trap, as well as oscillations between bound and unbound molecular states.

Low-field centers related to Cr3+ substitution of Nb5+ (CrNb) occur in addition to CrLi in co-doped Cr,Mg:LiNbO3 samples. Application of high hydrostatic pressure leads to the transformation of dominant Cr3+ centers from low- to high-field type due to strong pressure-induced blue shift of the 4 T 2 state, resulting in its crossing with the 2 E state of Cr3+. This level-crossing effect was observed for the dominant Cr3+ Li and Cr3+ Nb centers at pressures that correlate well with estimations based on the 4 T 2-2 Eenergy gap (230 cm-1 and 1160 cm-1) and on the rate of their pressure-induced change (14.35 and 11.4 cm-1/kbar, respectively).

However, the latitude dependence of the solar plasma output into interplanetary space (including fast-stream and magnetic turbulence effects) seems to be important in determining the magnitude of modulation." .

We performed dynamic contrastenhancement computed tomography in both of our cases and dynamic contrast enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in one case. These dynamic studies showed a demarcated mass with delayed enhancement in both cases. A T1-weighted MR image shows a mass with homogeneous low signal intensity, and a T2- weighted image shows a mass with slightly high signal intensity. A post-contrast-enhanced T1-weighted image demonstrates homogeneous enhancement. We speculate that the delayed enhancement could be attributed to the abundant fibrous tissue, which was the main structural material of the tumor.

A sequence of events started with an M3.5 X-ray class flare on 22 August 2015 at 21:19 UTC. The New-Tupi muon telescopes observed a Forbush decrease (FD) triggered by this geomagnetic storm, which began on 26 August 2015. After Earth crossed the heliospheric current sheet (HCS), an increase in particle flux was observed on 28 August 2015 by spacecraft and ground-level detectors. The observed peak was in temporal coincidence with the impact of a high-speed stream (HSS). We study this increase, which has been observed with a significance above 1.5% by ground-level detectors in different rigidity regimes. We also estimate the lower limit of the energy fluence injected on Earth. In addition, we consider the origin of this increase, such as acceleration of particles by shock waves at the front of the HSS and the focusing effect of the HCS crossing. Our results show possible evidence of a prolonged energetic (up to GeV energies) particle injection within the Earth atmosphere system, driven by the HSS. In most cases, these injected particles are directed to the polar regions. However, the particles from the high-energy tail of the spectrum can reach mid-latitudes, and this could have consequences for the atmospheric chemistry. For instance, the creation of NOx species may be enhanced, and this can lead to increased ozone depletion. This topic requires further study." .

Applied at 10 μM, the known auxins indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), α-naphthalene acetic acid (αNAA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and indole-3-butyric acid, the two analogues β-naphthalene acetic acid and 2,3-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and acetic acid transiently (1–30 min) depolarized the membrane potential; but a subsequent hyperpolarization, possibly resulting from activation of the plasma-membrane H+-ATPase, occurred only with active auxins. The magnitude and duration of the depolarizations induced by the different compounds varied. The αNAA-induced depolarization consisted of two depolarization events. The first reached a maximum within 2–3 min and the second between 6 and 10 min. The magnitude of the first αNAA-induced depolarization varied with external concentration of Cl− suggesting that it represents an efflux of Cl−. A known anion-channel blocker, anthracene-9-carboxylic acid, at 1 μM prevented the Cl−-sensitive depolarization induced by αNAA. The same concentration failed to block αNAA-induced elongation of peeled coleoptile segments, though higher concentrations (20 μM and 100 μM) increasingly inhibited growth. Applied at 10 μM, the naturally occurring auxin, IAA, induced a single depolarization (maximal between 6 and 8 min) which was insensitive to external Cl− concentration. The depolarization induced by 10 μM IAA, as well as that induced by acetic acid and the second depolarization induced by 10 μM αNAA, increased in magnitude when the pH of the perfusate was lowered from 6.0 to 4.5. When IAA was applied at a higher concentration (100 μM) the magnitude of the depolarization increased, lengthened, and also contained an early, Cl−-sensitive, depolarization (maximal between 2 and 4 min). The Cl−-sensitive depolarization induced by αNAA also increased when αNAA was increased from 10 to 100 μM, but, while 10 and 100 μM IAA and 10 μM αNAA induced elongation of peeledAvena coleoptile segments, 100 μM αNAA did not. Our results suggest that: (i) the putative Cl− currents induced by 10 μM αNAA and 100 μM IAA are the result of the opening of a population of Cl−-permeable anion channels, (ii) activation of these channels is not required for the auxin-induced growth ofAvena coleoptiles, (iii) the pH-sensitive depolarization induced by αNAA and IAA is not an auxin-specific response and might result from a weak acid protonophore effect, and (iv) the delayed hyperpolarization is a specific response to auxins inAvena coleoptiles." .

The proton density and temperature and the magnetic magnitude simultaneously increased for about 6 h. This pressure rise was associated with a comparatively large southward now velocity component (with Vz ≈ − 100 km · s−1) and magnetic-field rotation. The pressure enhancement was associated with unusual features in the electron distribution function. It shows a wide angular distribution of electron counting rates in the low-energy (57.8 eV) channel, while previous to the enhancement it exhibits a wide angular distribution of electron count rate in the high-energy (112, 221 and 309 eV) channels, perhaps indicating the mirroring of electrons in the converging field lines of the background magnetic field. These fluid and kinetic phenomena may be explained as resulting from an interplanetary magnetic flux rope which is not fully convected by the flow but moves against the background wind towards the Sun." .

The comparative analysis of the STM images at scales from hundreds of nanometers down to atomic scale reveals the differences of surface features for carbon fibres processed from different precursors, polyacrylonitrile fibres and pitch. The high temperature treatment of carbon fibres — the so-called graphitization process — as used to improve the stress modulus induces drastically increased ordering phenomena at the atomic level. Structural information obtained by STM on the surface of the fibres as well as in their cross sectional areas is discussed in comparison with known results of diffraction studies.

Radio imaging observations by the Nançay radioheliograph (NRH) of these bursts showed a very complex event that can be regarded as global: the sources encompassed all the visible range in longitude and a huge span in latitude. Another interesting feature of the radio event is its recurrent nature: after the most intense phase shortly after 10:00 UT, two other strong outbursts are detected, one at about 12:50 UT and another at about 13:48 UT. All of these sub-events showed similar development and likely evidence for CMEs. The launch of a CME in association with the 14:00 UT sub-event is inferred from WIND/WAVES, with interplanetary type II signatures in the hectometric wavelength range at that time. These later events were not detected by LASCO due to energetic particles hitting the CCD. During the Bastille Day event, energetic particle observations measured in situ by ACE/EPAM are dominated by energetic electrons. Changes in anisotropy and energy spectrum of the ∼38–350 keV electrons suggest a good correlation with the coronal radio observations. In addition to the three main radio events and particle observations, the NRH data reveal moving features in the southern hemisphere. These moving features, located at about 45 deg south and with an angular extent of about 45 deg, are illuminated by non-thermal electrons and are seen at distances up to 2.5 solar radii from the Sun center. More generally, we interpret the global and recurrent coronal activity, revealed by the radio data, as responsible for populating the interplanetary medium with energetic electrons." .

Each fragment contained about 8 nuclei. The volume of the fragments remained constant under slight compression, but was halved under strong compression. The fragmentation showed a sharp temperature transition. The transition temperature was constant at 16 °C when plasmodia had been cultured above 16 °C, and decreased gradually as the culture temperature decreased below 16 °C. Both cycloheximide and actinomycin D inhibited the fragmentation in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the transcription and protein synthesis took a part in the fragmentation.

The method involves measurement of the granule/intergranule contrast as a function of wavelength on a sequence of filtergrams taken with the CSIRO computer-controlled 1/8 Å filter in the photospheric line Fe i λ6569.2. A procedure based on a simple but realistic morphological model of the granulation pattern is used to correct for spatial smearing. The effects of spectral smearing and of scattered light are also taken into account. The present observations reveal a one hundred per cent correlation between brightness and the sense of the vertical velocity component and thus demonstrate beyond doubt the convective origin of the granulation. The new measurements yield a value of ≈1.8 km s−1 for the difference between the upward and downward velocities associated with an average granule. With certain plausible assumptions this leads to granular and intergranular velocities of ≈0.7 km s−1 (upward) and ≈1.1 km s−1 (downward) respectively. Estimates are also obtained for the (true) central intensities and line broadening parameters of the line profile, separately for the average granule and intergranular lane." .

Besides ionospheric effects, the seasonal variations of the amplitude of the received signal have been carefully examined in this paper. The regular amplitude of the signal shows that the sunrise fade minimum lags well behind the ionospheric sunrise and it varies from season to season. Along the path of propagation which is very close to the tropic of cancer, the four important meteorological seasons are pre-monsoon (March–June), monsoon (July–September), post-monsoon (October–November) and winter (December–February), and the meteorological parameters of these seasons have been found to impress the signal amplitude. The signal amplitude has been found to be remarkably related to the product of the temperature and relative humidity. The correlation lies on the fact that humid air possesses a finite conductivity which controls the attenuation of the long wave while passing through the tropospheric regions in multiple paths." .

Although the arc-minute angular resolution of the radio telescope is insufficient to map individual active regions, the unique capability of this radio telescope to map the whole solar disc in a single operation makes it useful for identifying and measuring sources of the slowly-varying component, which at this wavelength are largely due to free–free thermal emission from plasma concentrations trapped in active region magnetic fields. The brightness temperatures of the emission are higher in large, complex active regions, suggesting the plasma slab producing the emission is thicker and/or denser in such regions. We find also that the relationship between the brightness temperature and the size and complexity of the host region is a function of the phase of the 10–13-year solar activity cycle." .

The measurements were made from Poker Flat Research Range, Alaska (65.1°N, 147.5°W), during August 1986. Simultaneous photographic observations of the northern twilight sky were made from Gulkana, Alaska (62.2°N, 145.5°W), approximately 340 km to the south to establish the presence of NLCs over the spectrometer site. Data exhibiting significant short-term variations in the relative intensity (as much as 50-100%) and rotational temperature (typically 5–15 K) were recorded on six occasions when NLCs were observed. Joint measurements were also obtained on several “cloud-free” nights. No obvious relationship was found linking the mean OH intensity or its variation with the occurrence of NLCs. However, a clear tendency was found for the mean OH temperature to be lower on NLC nights than on cloud-free nights. In particular, a significant fraction of the OH(3-1) band spectra recorded by each instrument (16-57%) exhibited temperatures below \\sim154 K on NLC nights compared with <3% on cloud-free nights. This result is qualitatively consistent with current models for ice particle nucleation and growth, but the mean OH temperature on NLC nights (\\sim156 K) was significantly higher than would be expected for long-term particle growth in this region. These observations raise questions concerning the expected proximity of the high-latitude, summertime OH layer and the NLC growth region." .

The single point energy calculations were refined further using the G2(MP2) method. Two conformers relatively close in energy were identified for ETFA; both are likely to be important in the temperature range of our study. The existence of transition states on the corresponding potential energy surface was ascertained by performing intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations. The rate constant at 298 K calculated theoretically using canonical transition state theory was found to be in good agreement with experimentally measured values. Our calculations suggest that H abstraction from the –CH2 group is kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable than abstraction from the –CH3 group.

Our 91 cm observations show the onset of Type I noise storm emission about an hour after an EUV ejection event was detected by EIT and TRACE. The EUV event also coincided with the estimated start time of a CME detected by the LASCO C2 coronagraph, suggesting an association between the production of nonthermal particles and evolving plasma-magnetic field structures at different heights in the corona. On another day, our VLA 400 cm observations reveal weak, impulsive microbursts that occurred sporadically throughout the middle corona. These low-brightness-temperature (T b=0.7–22×106 K) events may be weak Type III bursts produced by beams of nonthermal electrons which excite plasma emission at a height where the local plasma frequency or its first harmonic equals the observing frequency of 74 MHz. For one microburst, the emission was contained in two sources separated by ∼0.7 R 0, indicating that the electron beams had access to widely-divergent magnetic field lines originating at a common site of particle acceleration. Another 400 cm microburst occurred in an arc-like source lying at the edge of EUV loops that appeared to open outward into the corona, possibly signaling the start of a CME. In most instances the 400 cm microbursts were not accompanied by detectable EUV activity, suggesting that particles that produce the microbursts were independently accelerated in the middle corona, perhaps as the result of some quasi-continuous, large-scale process of energy release." .

Local heating caused by the focused laser light must be also taken in account, since it may affect the Raman spectrum in a similar fashion, even at relatively low laser power levels.

From the evolution of the distribution function with time elapsed since the field line was opened, both the observed energy/observation-time and pitch-angle/energy dispersions are well reproduced. Distribution functions showing a mixture of magnetosheath and magnetospheric ions, often thought to be a signature of the LLBL, are found on newly opened field lines as a natural consequence of the magnetopause effects on the ions and their flight times. In addition, it is shown that the extent of the source region of the magnetosheath ions that are detected by a satellite is a function of the sensitivity of the ion instrument . If the instrument one-count level is high (and/or solar-wind densities are low), the cusp ion precipitation detected comes from a localised region of the mid-latitude magnetopause (around the magnetic cusp), even though the reconnection takes place at the equatorial magnetopause. However, if the instrument sensitivity is high enough, then ions injected from a large segment of the dayside magnetosphere (in the relevant hemisphere) will be detected in the cusp. Ion precipitation classed as LLBL is shown to arise from the low-latitude magnetopause, irrespective of the instrument sensitivity. Adoption of threshold flux definitions has the same effect as instrument sensitivity in artificially restricting the apparent source region." .

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and optical absorption studies of Li2O–MoO3–B2O3 with varying concentrations of Li2O, MoO3 and B2O3 have been carried out at room temperature. Two series of glasses, one with constant MoO3 (CM) and another with constant borate (CB), have been investigated. Characteristic EPR spectra of Mo5+ have been observed centered around g ≅ 2.00, which are attributed to Mo5+ ion in an octahedral coordination sphere with an axial distortion. The spectra also show strong dependence on the concentration of Li2O and B2O3. Spin concentrations (N) and magnetic susceptibilities (χ) have been calculated. In the CM series, the N values decrease with increasing Li2O content up to 30 mol%, while in the CB series variation of N is found to increase initially up to 20 mol%, and with further increase in the Li2O content the N values tend to decrease. The variation of magnetic susceptibilities is almost similar to that observed with the variation of N. From the optical absorption spectra, an absorption edge (α) has been evaluated. In the CM series, the values of α show a blueshift. On the other hand, in the CB series a redshift is observed. The observed variations in spectral parameters are explained by considering the molybdoborate network. Addition of Li2O to the CM and CB series results in modification of [MoO6/2]0 → [MoOO5/2]− and [BO3/2]0 → [BO4/2]− → [BOO2/2]− groups, respectively, leading to creation of nonbridging oxygens. The optical basicity of the glasses has been evaluated in both the CM and the CB glasses. The optical basicity can be used to classify the covalent-to-ionic ratios of the glass, since an increasing optical basicity indicates decreasing covalency. It is observed that the covalency between Mo5+ ions and oxygen ligands increases in the CB series, whereas in the CM series the covalency between Mo5+ ions and oxygen ligands decreases." .

The geometries, electronic properties and nonlinear response of TAH derivatives were studied using density functional theory at the B3PW91/6-311++G (2d, 2p) level. Charge transfer and nonlinear optical response were analyzed and correlated with modifications in geometry and energy levels. Calculations indicated that trivial changes in the torsional angle occur in TAH derivatives with electron-donating substituents as compared to those with electron-withdrawing substituents, resulting in lower reorganization energies for TAH derivatives 2–6. TAH derivatives with an –N(CH3)2 group have the greatest highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, and thus the least ionization potential, indicating significant hole transfer efficiency as compared to unsubstituted TAH. A decrease in the HOMO–LUMO gap occurs upon substitution with electron-releasing groups, whereas there is an increase in the case of –NO2, –COOH, and –CN TAH derivatives. Topological analysis of the HOMOs of the neutral molecules revealed that these orbitals are concentrated mainly in the helicene backbone, with an important contribution from fused phenyl rings, nitrogen atoms and carbonyl groups. However, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) are invariably constituted by fused phenyl rings without any contribution from the central nitrogen atom. Studying the effect of substitution on the nonlinear optical response of TAH derivatives, the calculated polarizability and hyperpolarizability at B3PW91/6-311++G (2d,2p) level of theory exhibited a prominent improvement as compared to unsubstituted TAH. Both electron-donating groups and electron-withdrawing groups result in a red shift in the electronic absorption bands of the substitution derivatives, in particular those with –N(CH3)2 and –NH2 groups.

This applies particularly to salient pole synchronous machines which have considerably higher variations of the air gap permeance than induction machines due to their pole gap. Based on the FEM calculation results which are presented in Misir et al. (e&i, Elektrotech.

The operating principle and description of the DSMG are interpreted. Under the in-phase, anti-phase, and single-mass excitation conditions, the motion characteristics of the drive mode and sense mode are deduced. The non-ideal dynamics of the drive and sense modes with stiffness errors are analyzed. Then, the finite element simulation of the DSMG with a stiffness error is implemented to verify the non-ideal dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that the left and right masses share the same natural frequencies in the in-phase or anti-phase drive modes even with the existence of stiffness errors. However, a significant amplitude difference between the left and right proof masses can be observed in the in-phase and anti-phase drive modes. The harmonic response analysis proves that the in-phase drive mode is activated even under anti-phase excitation conditions. Finally, sweep frequency experiments are performed on the fabricated DSMG to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis. Experimental results indicate that the in-phase and anti-phase modes are excited simultaneously under both the anti-phase and in-phase excitation conditions because of the stiffness errors resulting from fabrication errors. This outcome is consistent with the theoretical analysis and simulation." .

Gold nanoparticles are the material that is mostly used experimentally, since it combines a favorable dielectric function in the red and near-IR with excellent chemical stability. So, the gold material is used to build nanoantennas in this research. The optical properties of plasmonic dimer nanoantennas are investigated in detail using the finite integration technique. The validity of this technique is verified by comparison to the exact solution generalized Mie method (GMM). The influence of the geometrical parameters (antenna length, gap dimension, and shapes) on the antenna field enhancement and spectral response is discussed. Localized surface plasmon resonances of Au (gold) dimers nanospheres, bowtie and aperture bowtie nanoantennas are modeled. The enhanced field is equivalent to a strong light spot which can lead to the resolution improvement of the microscopy and optical lithography, thus increasing the optical data storage capacity. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the antennas to index changes of the environment and substrate is investigated in detail for biosensing applications. We confirm that our approach yields an exact correspondence with GMM theory, for Au dimers nanospheres at gap dimension 5 and 10 nm but gives an approximation error of less than 1.37 % for gap dimension 1 and 2 nm with diameters approaching 80 nm. In addition, the far-field characteristics of the aperture bowtie nanoantenna such as directivity and gain are studied.

Best-fitting multivariable correlation splines, with strictly given coefficients, are obtained. The provided correlation splines conveniently interpolate the maximum design parameters of the base beam over a wide range of load inertia and velocity. Results provided are valid for any geometry and elastic stiffness of the beam, thanks to a properly set normalization factor here defined.

Special attention is given to the occurrence of mean-motion resonances, because they carry important information about the history of the planetary systems. At the early stages of the evolution, when planets are still embedded in a gaseous disc, the tidal interactions between the disc and planets cause the planetary orbital migration. The convergent differential migration of two planets embedded in a gaseous disc may result in the capture into a mean-motion resonance. The orbital migration taking place during the early phases of the planetary system formation may play an important role in shaping stable planetary configurations. An understanding of this stage of the evolution will provide insight on the most frequently formed architectures, which in turn are relevant for determining the planet habitability. The aim of this paper is to present the observational properties of these planetary systems which contain confirmed or suspected resonant configurations. A complete list of known systems with such configurations is given. This list will be kept by us updated from now on and it will be a valuable reference for studying the dynamics of extrasolar systems and testing theoretical predictions concerned with the origin and the evolution of planets, which are the most plausible places for existence and development of life." .

Unlike the uniform plasma case the structure propagates with the energy losses in the form of Langmuir waves. The results obtained are compared with the results of observations of type III bursts.

In this work, the excitation of fast waves in solar coronal loops modelled as dense plasma cylindrical tubes in a uniform straight magnetic field is investigated. We study the trapped and especially leaky modes (whose energy escapes from the tube) that result from an initial disturbance by solving the time-dependent problem numerically. We find that the stationary state of the tube motion is given by the trapped normal modes. By contrast, the transient behaviour between the initial and the stationary phase is dominated by wave leakage. The so-called trig leaky modes are clearly identified since the transient behaviour shows periods and damping times that are in agreement with the values calculated from the normal-mode analysis. Consequently, these radiating modes have physical significance. However, we have not found any evidence for the excitation of other types of modes, such as the principal leaky kink mode." .

The potential difference between an electric field probe and its spacecraft (with conductive surfaces) can be used to determine the ambient electron density and/or electron flux with limited accuracy but with high time resolution, of the order of 10–100 ms. It is necessary for the development of this diagnostic method to understand the photoemission characteristics of probes and satellites. According to the electric field experiments on the above-mentioned satellites, all materials develop very similar photoemission properties when they are beyond the influence of atmospheric oxygen. The photoelectron yield steadily increases over the first few months in space and reaches values well above those measured on clean surfaces in the laboratory. The method can be used for solar radiation levels corresponding to distances from 0.4 to 5 AU from the Sun." .

The maintenance of tidal dissipation in Io and the occurrence of the same on Enceladus depends crucially on the maintenance of the respective orbital eccentricities by the existence of mean motion resonances with nearby satellites. A formation of the resonances among the Galilean satellites by differential expansion of the satellite orbits from tides raised on Jupiter by the satellites means the onset of the volcanism on Io could be relatively recent. If, on the other hand, the resonances formed by differential migration from resonant interactions of the satellites with the disk of gas and particles from which they formed, Io would have been at least intermittently volcanically active throughout its history. Either means of assembling the Galilean satellite resonances lead to the same constraint on the dissipation function of Jupiter Q J ≲ 106, where the currently high heat flux from Io seems to favor episodic heating as Io's eccentricity periodically increases and decreases. Either of the two models might account for sufficient tidal dissipation in the icy satellite Enceladus to cause at least occasional cryovolcanism over much of its history. However, both models are assumption-dependent and not secure, so uncertainty remains on how tidal dissipation resurfaced Enceladus." .

However, their immunotoxicity in vivo remains unknown. In this article, the in vitro biocompatibility of the Gd2O3 nanoprobe was evaluated in terms of cell uptake, cell viability, and apoptosis. In vivo immunotoxicity was detected by monitoring the levels of the immunity mediator, cluster of differentiation (CD) markers in Balb/c mice. The results show that no in vitro cytotoxicity was observed, and no significant changes in the expression levels of CD206 and CD69 between the nanoprobe-injected group and the Gd-DTPA group in mice were observed. Importantly, the immunotoxicity data revealed significant differences in the expression levels of CD40, CD80, CD11b, and reactive oxygen species. In addition, transmission electron microscopy images showed that few Gd2O3 nanoprobes were localized in phagosomes by the endocytic pathway. In conclusion, the toxic effects of our Gd2O3 nanoprobe may be due to endocytosis during which the microstructure or ultrastructure of cells is slightly damaged and induces the generation of an oxidative stress reaction that further stimulates the innate immune response. Therefore, it is important to use a sensitive assay for the in vivo immunotoxicity measurements to evaluate the risk assessment of Gd2O3-based biomaterials at the molecular level." .

A closed system of equations is written for the thermal energy per heavy particle, the electron temperature, and the relative concentrations of elements in all ionization states. In addition to hydrogen and helium, atomic, singly ionized, and doubly ionized carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sodium, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, sulfur, potassium, calcium, and iron are included, assuming they have their normal cosmic abundances. The high optical depth in Lyman-series lines leads to a return of the thermal energy to electrons via secondary collisions. As a result, the contribution of hydrogen to the cooling rate falls to the level of the contribution of metals, mainly carbon, magnesium, and iron. Thus, such shock models are able to explain the presence of bright metal lines in the spectra of cool and solar-type stars." .

It is less well known that flares also cause changes in the inclination angle of chromospheric magnetic field lines (Bruzek, 1975). Inclination angle changes are notable in that horizontal field lines take the form of fibrils, while vertical field lines take the form of plages (Marsh, 1976). This study examines a complete sample of large flares to determine when the field inclination changes during the flare. The Hard X-ray Burst Spectrometer Event Listing (Dennis et. al, 1985) was searched for events with total counts > 105 and start times > 14 UT but <24 UT. Big Bear Solar Observatory Hα films were examined to identify which X-ray events show large horizontal ribbon motion over regions of fibrils. Of the 7 events found, 6 contain areas of the chromosphere that have the magnetic field direction turned from horizontal to vertical. The change in field direction at a given location occurs after the arrival of the ribbon, often 103 to 104 s after the flare start. No change in the chromosphere is seen before the ribbon arrival. These observations show that field lines involved in the flare do not spend more than a few minutes in “open” configurations before reconnecting to new partners, independent of the flare duration. The transit time of an Alfvén wave down a magnetic field line is only ≈102 s. Flare models that postulate field line disconnection or opening which lasts longer than the Alfvén time are ruled out, since the chromospheric footpoints are observed not to change before the ribbon arrival (field line energization). The captive filament eruption model (Moore and LaBonte, 1980) also implies field line alterations lasting the duration of the flare, and is thus ruled out. Successful flare models should have the behavior of a brushfire, with the free energy in one bush (field line) released only after the burning (flare energy deposition) in its neighbor raises its own temperature over the ignition point (inductively raises the free energy density over the flare threshold). The flare continues until the inductive energy density increase is small enough to be contained by the normal nonflare processes. A full description of the observations and their implications will appear in a future paper. This work is supported by NASA Grant NSG 7536." .

The slab is considered to have a one-dimensional inhomogeneity of the Alfvén speed in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the slab, which coincides with the equilibrium, straight, magnetic field. This magnetic configuration models an oscillating coronal loop that is formed by a bundle of field-aligned, smooth, concentric, circular shells of variable density and width. The number of the layers (or shells), along with their density, width, and radial steepness, are randomly distributed. It is shown that the resonant properties of long-wavelength sausage standing modes of the slab are not sensitive to the details of fine structuring.

In the first state, the Hall resistivity exhibits an inflection near the value ρxy=h/e 2 scaled to one Ge layer. The longitudinal magnetoresistivity ρxx(B) possesses a minimum in the range of fields where this inflection occurs. The temperature evolution of the inflection in ρxy(B), the minimum of ρ xx(B), and the value of ρxy at the inflection indicates a weakly expressed state of the quantum Hall effect with a uniform current distribution over the layers. In the second metastable state, an unusually wide plateau near h/2e 2 with a very weak field dependence is observed in ρxy(B). Estimates show that in these samples the Fermi level lies below but close to the top of the inflection in the bottom of the well. For this reason, the second state can be explained by separation of a hole gas in the Ge layers into two sublayers, and the saturation of ρxy(B) near h/2e 2 can be explained by the formation of a quantum Hall insulator state." .

Observations carried out in the Hα line, flare spectra, and the methods of analysing the flare spectra are briefly discussed. Great attention is paid to the continuous emission of flares in the optical spectral region. In the last section, optical aspects of proton flares are summarized." .

Currents through NMDA channels were evoked by application of 100 μM aspartate in magnesium-free medium containing glycine (3 μM) to neurons. Analysis of the kinetics, charge transfer, and relationships between the extent of suppression of stationary currents on the one hand and membrane potential, agonist concentration, and blocker concentration on the other showed that blockers had different effects on the closing, desensitization, and agonist dissociation of NMDA channels. The size of the blocker was found to be the decisive factor determining its action on the gating functions of NMDA channels: larger blockers prevented closure and/or desensitization of the channel; smaller blockers only had partial effects on these processes, while the smallest blockers had no effect at all. These experiments showed that the apparent affinity of the blocker for the channel (1/IC50) depended not only on the microscopic equilibrium dissociation constant (K d), but also on the number of blocker binding sites, their mutual influences, and, of particular importance, the interaction of the blocker with the gating structures of the channel. These data led us to propose hypotheses relating to the geometry of the NMDA channel and the structure of its gating mechanism. The channel diameter at the level of activated gates was estimated to be 11 Å." .
