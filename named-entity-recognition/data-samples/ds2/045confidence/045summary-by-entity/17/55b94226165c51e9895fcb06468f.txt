Abstract The suppression of unwanted thoughts has been hypothesized to play an important role in the maintenance of clinical disorders such as OCD and PTSD. The present study sought to examine the singular and combined effects of thought suppression instructions and anxiety induction (as induced by an anticipated impromptu speech) on the frequency of threat-relevant thoughts. Socially anxious participants were randomized to one of four conditions: (a) thought suppression instructions—anticipated speech; (b) thought suppression instructions—no anticipated speech; (c) no thought suppression instructions—anticipated speech; and (d) no thought suppression instructions—no anticipated speech. Contrary to prediction, those instructed to suppress their target thoughts under conditions of heightened anxiety reported fewer anxious thoughts following suppression than the non-suppression group. This effect was not observed among participants in the no anxiety induction control condition. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that anxiety induction may actually facilitate successful suppression of threat-relevant thoughts. Theoretical implications are discussed.
