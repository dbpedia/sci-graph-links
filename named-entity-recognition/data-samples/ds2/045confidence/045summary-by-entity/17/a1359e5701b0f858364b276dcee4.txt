Here we solve an open problem considered by various researchers by presenting the first explicit constructions of an infinite family $$ {\\user1{\\mathcal{F}}} $$ of bounded-degree ‘unique-neighbor’ concentrators Γ; i.e., there are strictly positive constants α and ε, such that all Γ = (X,Y,E(Γ)) ∈ $$ {\\user1{\\mathcal{F}}} $$ satisfy the following properties. The output-set Y has cardinality $$ \\frac{{21}} {{22}} $$ times that of the input-set X, and for each subset S of X with no more than α|X| vertices, there are at least ε|S| vertices in Y that are adjacent in Γ to exactly one vertex in S. Also, the construction of $$ {\\user1{\\mathcal{F}}} $$ is simple to specify, and each $$ \\Gamma \\in {\\user1{\\mathcal{F}}} $$ has fewer than $$ \\frac{{7{\\left| {V{\\left( \\Gamma \\right)}} \\right|}}} {2} $$ edges. We then modify $$ {\\user1{\\mathcal{F}}} $$ to obtain explicit unique-neighbor concentrators of maximum degree 3.
