Abstract We examine the long-range exclusion process introduced by Spitzer and studied by Liggett and answer some of the open questions raised by Liggett. In particular, we show the existence of equilibria corresponding to bounded dual harmonic functions and that the process can have right-discontinuous paths at strictly positive times. We also show that “explosions” when they occur, do so at fixed times determined by the initial configuration. Finally, we give an example for which the configuration with all sites occupied is not stable although the rate at which particles arrive at any given site for that configuration is infinite.
