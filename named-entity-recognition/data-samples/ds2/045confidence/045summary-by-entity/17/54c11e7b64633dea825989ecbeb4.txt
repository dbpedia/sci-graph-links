Abstract This paper shares some of the author’s conclusions following more than three decades of experience with evaluation in a range of areas, including agricultural research, health and social development projects, and programs managed by both national and international agencies. It expounds on the purposes, processes and products of evaluation as well as the probity of the evaluators. Evaluations are often expected to achieve multiple objectives in a short time period and with limited resources. The conclusions and recommendations of evaluations often influence a program’s future course, as well as the reputation of program managers and staff. When there is no effective monitoring or internal evaluation system in place, an external evaluation team must rely heavily on the probity and creativity of its members, particularly, the team leader. This paper offers tips on practical aspects of monitoring and evaluation, and provides insights into research and development processes in developing countries.
