Abstract. The perspectives of a search for the rare decay $K_L\\to\\pi^0\\nu\\bar\\nu$ at a $\\Phi$â€“factory are discussed. After a general analysis, we focus on the realistic case of KLOE and DA $\\Phi$NE, showing that limits of the order of $10^{-9}$ on BR( $K_L\\to\\pi^0\\nu\\bar\\nu$) are achievable in the next few years. We also discuss the theoretical implications of this kind of measurements.
