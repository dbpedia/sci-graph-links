Summary Foveal perceptive fields (center plus surround) for human vision were investigated by means of contrast illusions in grids and bars. The task consisted of determining the size of the retinal area within which photic stimulation of the periphery induces apparent brightness changes of the central portions. The mean of the individual thresholds obtained in four experiments suggests a total field diameter of 17.8 min of arc (with an estimated 4.0â€² corresponding to the center) for on-and off-center fields. It is assumed that this average value refers to perceptive fields of retinal ganglion cells. The significance of eye movements and afterimages in contrast vision and their possible influence on these measurements is discussed.
