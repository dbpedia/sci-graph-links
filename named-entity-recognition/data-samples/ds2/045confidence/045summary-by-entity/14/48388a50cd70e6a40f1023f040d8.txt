We introduce and formalize a class of multi-round (dynamic) procedures for collective estimation and choice among options. A technique is developed for investigating models of this class by entropy functions of a special form. Methods are proposed for the analysis of convergence, stability, accuracy, completeness, and adequacy of the proposed procedures. The analysis identifies a certain type of sufficiently simple models that have the best characteristics in the given class.
