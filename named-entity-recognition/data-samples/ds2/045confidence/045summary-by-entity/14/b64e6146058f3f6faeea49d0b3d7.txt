Abstract XYZ Company spends millions of dollars in the procurement of spare parts and tools every year. The maintenance part plays the role of sustaining the technical readiness of the equipment and vehicles. This research will try to find ways to reduce total inventory cost while maintaining the targeted level of technical readiness. The research consists of two phases of multi-criteria decision making on total inventory cost and technical readiness. First phase is to apply a 2-dimentional material classification technique to the selected data. Thus, a combination of ABC- and 123-analysis is used to simplify the problem by focusing on costly items only. The second phase is to apply a deterministic inventory model to the results of the material classification. A detailed analysis of the technical readiness and total inventory cost is covered for the deterministic inventory model. The objective of this research is to design a new system to balance readiness and the associated total inventory cost by finding the relationship between the desired level of technical readiness and cost. Finally, a comparison between the current inventory system and the proposed one shows around 42% savings in the total inventory cost over a period of 3 years, (Adi in Optimizing total inventory cost and enhancing technical readiness level.
