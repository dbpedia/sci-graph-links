Abstract Archaeologists, geographers, and economists recognize a vital linkage between transport conditions and urban development. Archaeologists attribute aspects of the Mesoamerican urban tradition to the limiting effects of inefficient transport. The relationship between transport and population growth is evaluated here. A large sample of preindustrial European cities with known populations is categorized according to the navigability of their waterways, and their growth is monitored over three centuries. Median population sizes were consistently lower among landlocked cities than among seaports and cities on rivers. Effects of population stasis was more pronounced among landlocked cities. Capital cities appeared able to stretch population limits in each category, but not to elude them. The applicability of the model to prehistoric urban development is discussed, as are potential problems that would be encountered.
