Abstract The powerful energy-balance systems approach was applied to the quantification of man-environment relations in an urban area. Nine special purpose energy-balance models of man-environment relations are summarized. Physiologic comfort is defined. Research resulted in the development of a general purpose man model for predicting the elements which can be used to derive the comfort of man in any environment as well as the magnitudes and directions of the various energy exchanges. The model has been applied to the special case of summertime thermal comfort of individuals in various parts of a large city (Sacramento, California) and has revealed quantitative information on the unique microclimates within a city.
