Abstract As ‘sustainable development’ has become a global focus, “Green Building” or “Sustainable Building (SB)” is the need of the day. These buildings not only reduce negative environmental impact but also improve human comfort and safety. Sustainable Buildings need to be assessed by ‘Assessment tool’ for checking its overall contribution towards achievement of ‘sustainability’. In this paper an attempt is made to know Indian Architects ‘perceptions’ and ‘preferences’ regarding the framework of “Sustainable Building Assessment Tool (SBAT)” for India. Feedbacks were collected from the Architects of major metro cities of India. Total 81 responses were analyzed with SPSS 12 statistical analysis software. Indian Architects’ gave an opinion that ‘SBAT’ for India should be prepared firstly for commercial buildings. It should target ‘Architects’ first and must be applied at the building level. ‘SBAT’ should be a comprehensive one with flexible and easy to calculate scoring system. ‘SBAT’ must cover non-controllable factors along with negative scoring system. Results can be utilized in the coming years to prepare a comprehensive ‘SBAT’ for developing country like India.
