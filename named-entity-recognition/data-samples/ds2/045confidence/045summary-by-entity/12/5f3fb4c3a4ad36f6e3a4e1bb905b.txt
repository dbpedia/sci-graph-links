Abstract Groups of secondary schoolchildren in England were asked to assess thermal conditions in winter according to subjective sensations of warmth. Individual comfort votes were averaged for each group and regressed, firstly on estimates of microclimatic warmth, and secondly, in combination with external meteorological parameters. It appeared that thermal comfort was related not only to indoor temperatures, but also to outdoor warmth. The most similar regressions between the sexes, however, contained variables also representing humidity and changes in the external warmth â€” humidity environment. In particular cool-humid days and changes to warmer-drier weather were related to a decreased need for indoor warmth.
