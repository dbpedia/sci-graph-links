Companies are increasingly being put under pressure from the market to design product and production better, faster, cheaper and more market-oriented. Insufficient coherence and synchronization between product, process and system design often lie at the basis of great design efforts and high design costs. This paper focuses on this subject, by introducing an integral assembly model to improve the insight into the interaction between product, process and system design. The objective of this model is to realize a controllable design process.
