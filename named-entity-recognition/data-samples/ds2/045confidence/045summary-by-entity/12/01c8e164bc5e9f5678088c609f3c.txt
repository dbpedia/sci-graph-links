Abstract This paper describes the land use and transport characteristics of a strip of urban development located along the northern shore of Hong Kong Island. The strip of land, with an area of 22.5 sq. km, is 17 km long and has an average width of 1.3 km. It has a population of approximately one million and provides over 700,000 jobs. Despite its small size, it accommodates the CBD, residential districts, shopping complexes as well as most of the civic/institutional facilities that a city needs. Its urban form is linear not by design but by default â€“ the topography of the area has constrained the development from spreading sideways. Surprisingly however, apart from economy in land utilization, it is considered to possess three other good qualities: high accessibility enjoyed by residents; few roads and commercially viable public transport. Its travel characteristics are analyzed, using results of a home interview survey conducted by the Government in 1992. In addition, various statistics published by the Government and public transport authorities are also used in the analysis.
