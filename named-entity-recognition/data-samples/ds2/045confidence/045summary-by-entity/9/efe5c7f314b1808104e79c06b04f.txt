Abstract Based on the model of spherical cavity expansion in brittle materials, which involves the concept of ultimate fracture velocities, we consider a stress-strain state in the elastic precursor zone and in the region of material broken by radial cracks. We have noted the mechanical effects of dynamic overload and fracture retardation, which arise within this model.
