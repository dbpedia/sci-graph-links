Summary The size of forest fragments, the use of land bordering fragments, and the distance of nests from an edge all affect the frequency of predation upon bird nests in Maine (USA), an area where the forest has been fragmented by roads, but not significantly reduced in area. We placed artificial nests containing quail eggs in forests of different sizes and at various distances from the edge to test which of these factors was most important in describing predation. Predation was greatest in small tracts surrounded completely by land. Large areas and those bordered on at least one side by a large water body had lower predation rates. This suggests that influx of predators from nearby habitats may be responsible for much of the nest predation in forest fragments.
