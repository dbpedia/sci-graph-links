Conclusion This multi-genre writing, multimedia, co-inquiry project produced successful end products. The middle school students gained experience in writing in a variety of genres, communicating through multiple media, and using education technology to do so. Likewise, the pre-service teachers developed their skills in these same areas. More importantly for our preservice teachers they gained teaching experience and had a chance to interact with students in the role of the teacher. This success would not have been achieved without the collaboration and cooperation of many individuals as well as access to the required technologies. The asynchronous discussion board was an important part of that success. This mode of telecommunications facilitated increased social and substantive interactions between the middle school students and the preservice teachers from the beginning to the end of the project. With careful consideration of the points and questions we present here, we hope that you will be able to adopt or adapt this mode of telecommunications to add value to your pre-service teachers’ teaching experiences and interactions with K-12 students.
