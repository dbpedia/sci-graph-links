Abstract An introductory chemistry laboratory designed for a high school or college environment is presented. The process of cider production is used to teach concepts related to fermentation and to allow students to expand their understanding of mass percent, stoichiometric calculations, and the ideal gas laws. This experiment was developed as part of a continuing curriculum reform effort in our introductory chemistry laboratories to integrate biological and chemical concepts, to reduce “cookbook” procedures, and to encourage students to use higher-order thinking skills. This approach has proven effective in stimulating student interest and in fostering greater student engagement in the learning process.
