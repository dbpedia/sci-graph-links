Abstract This study analyses future secondary school teachers’ perceptions of the teaching methodology used in a teacher training master’s degree programme. A descriptive study was designed and the data were collected by adapting the “Questionnaire to evaluate university professors’ teaching and assessment methodology” (n=252). Students achieve better results under the learning-centred model, which is related to the constructivist and student-centred system, rather than a traditional teaching-centred model, which is related to the teacher whose task is to expose information to students.
