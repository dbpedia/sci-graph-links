Abstract The use of cooperative learning in an online setting is examined using the online segment of a recently offered physical chemistry course as an example. The nature and function of classical, face-to-face cooperative learning are outlined. The online course segment is outlined and is analyzed with regard to the criteria for classical cooperative learning. Though this specific course segment functioned poorly when taught as online cooperative learning, it is possible to structure online courses to take advantage of the strengths of cooperative learning. The possible structure and function of an online cooperative learning community are explored, concluding with a specific model for online cooperative learning.
