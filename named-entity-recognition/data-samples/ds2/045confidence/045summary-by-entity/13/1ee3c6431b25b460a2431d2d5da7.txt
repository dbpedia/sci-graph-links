Abstract Interprofessional education has the potential to teach One Health topics in a novel interactive format, bringing together future health professionals in a format that allows them a first-hand understanding of the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration. The purpose of this study is to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs (KAB) of health professional students on One Health concepts following completion of an interprofessional education (IPE) course. The rationale behind the research is that while there are multiple studies that promote the importance of interdisciplinary care within the human medical field, there are no studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of using IPE to promote cross-disciplinary collaboration outside the realm of human health. Western University of Health Sciences (WUHS) is in a unique position to conduct just such research, as the WUHS IPE program is comprised of 1,200 students from across the health-care spectrum. Health professional studentâ€™s KAB of One Health were assessed utilizing a five-point Likert-scale survey, and the responses from the osteopathic medical and veterinary colleges were statistically analyzed via t test for comparison of means. This study provided valuable insights and identified gaps into the curricula and showed that following an IPE course, most students possessed a significant knowledge and appreciation of One Health. In addition, there were significant differences between veterinary and medical students in their ability to define One Health and in their appreciation of One Health concepts.
