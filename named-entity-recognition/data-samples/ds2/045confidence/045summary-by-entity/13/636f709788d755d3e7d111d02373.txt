Abstract PurposeTo address minority health disparities in maternal and child health (MCH), increasing the diversity of the MCH workforce is an important strategy. DescriptionGuided by the MCH Leadership Competencies, we developed an undergraduate pipeline program for disadvantaged students. Our target population is minority undergraduates who are interested in entering health professions but have academic challenges. We identify these students early in their undergraduate careers and expose them to the field of MCH through a 4-unit course, summer field practicum at an MCH community-based organization or agency, and volunteer experience in a student-run organization focused on helping children and families. We also provide academic advising and personal counseling by a faculty mentor and leadership training opportunities. AssessmentSince 2006, 75 students have participated in our program, of which 36 are still enrolled and 39 have graduated. Among the graduates, three (8 %) have completed graduate school and are working in a health field; 11 (28 %) are enrolled in graduate school; and 13 (33 %) are currently applying to graduate school. Of the remaining graduates, seven (18 %) are employed in a health field, and five (13 %) are working in an unrelated field. ConclusionPipeline programs should attempt to reach students as early as possible in their undergraduate careers to more effectively influence their academic trajectories. Many minority students face academic and personal challenges; therefore, intensive academic advising and one-on-one faculty mentoring are important components of pipeline programs.
