Abstract A television news message is conveyed in words, voice, facial expression, visual symbols and camera techniques. The qualitative analysis of a news videotape begins with choosing analytical units that meet one's theoretical goals but which do not do violence to the nature of the content at hand. After a transcription of the verbal content is done, patterns in the script and in journalist-news source interactions can be identified. The analyst then listens for “tunes” in news speech which may, for instance, convey humor or skepticism. Television news relies on a visual symbolic code consisting of objects that suggest the topic at hand, of conventions for camera angle and distance, and of journalists' facial expressions. A complete qualitative analysis of the news message produces an exhaustive data matrix showing the juxtaposition of all message elements. This becomes the foundation for a rigorous, wholistic “account of accounts.”
