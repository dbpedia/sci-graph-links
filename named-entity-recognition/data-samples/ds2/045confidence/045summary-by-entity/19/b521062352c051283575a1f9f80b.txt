Summary As parallel faces separated by a fluid film approach one another, a pressure is developed in the film. The reduced Navier-Stokes equations are solved by transform methods for both rectangular and cylindrical geometries. Relatively high pressures can exist at small asperities on the surfaces as they approach one another.
