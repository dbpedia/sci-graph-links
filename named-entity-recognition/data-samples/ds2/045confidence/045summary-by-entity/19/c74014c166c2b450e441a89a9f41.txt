Abstract A model of stratified medium with slightly rough interfaces is presented for analysis of scattering from oil film on sea surface. Because the thickness of oil film is considered, the model is more realistic than that raised in other paper in which only single rough surface is assumed. In this paper the coupled differential equations are derived and solved by full wave approach, and the simple expressions of back scattering cross section for oil film on sea surface have been obtained. According to these expressions some curves are given for different thickness of oil film. It is shown that the results obtained by the present model are in better agreement with the experimental data than those obtained by the single surface model.
