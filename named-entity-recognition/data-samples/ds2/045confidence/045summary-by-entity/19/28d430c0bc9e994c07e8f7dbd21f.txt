Abstract The clinical usefulness of a 2,048-×2,048-pixel matrix image intensifier television digital radiography system was evaluated. Screen-film and digital images (with and without postprocessing) of the upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract were used for clinical evaluation. For the upper GI tract, digital images processed with unsharp mask techniques were comparable in quality to screen-film images before and after upgrading the system. For the lower GI tract, screen-film images were better than digital images, except for those processed with a 2,048-×2,048-line monitor was comparable to a screen-film system.
