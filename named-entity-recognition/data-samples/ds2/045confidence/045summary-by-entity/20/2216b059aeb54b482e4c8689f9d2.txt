Abstract At least 44 different song types were recorded in a population of Coal Tits at Klaebu in central Norway. Each male sang up to 14 different types. In testing the Beau Geste hypothesis the following predictions were made: (1) Territorial males tend to change song type when moving from one song post to another. (2) The tendency to change song type when moving from one song post to another increases with the distance between the song posts. (3) Territory holders prefer inconspicuous song posts that reduce the chances of being instantly detected by possible intruders and prospectors. However, none of these predictions were confirmed by the data analyses. The singing behaviour of the Coal Tit does therefore not support the Beau Geste hypothesis.
