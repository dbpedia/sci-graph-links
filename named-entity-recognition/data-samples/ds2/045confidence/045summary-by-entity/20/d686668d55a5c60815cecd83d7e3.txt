One of the basic components of globalization is the integration process that involves all areas of human life including language evolution. We consequently look at this problem in terms of language and natural language processes influenced by a complex variety of factorsâ€”both interlinguistic and extralinguistic-focusing mainly on the linguistic contacts with emphasis on areal aspects.
