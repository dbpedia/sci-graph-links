Abstract Let there be given two F-spaces (X, ∥ ∥*), (Y, ∥ ∥*), X ⊂ Y. A series Σ1∞xi of elements in X is said to have property O(X, Y) (in the case when X = Y, ∥ ∥ = ∥ ∥*-property O) if perfect boundedness of this series in (X, ∥ ∥) implies its perfect (subseries) convergence in ( Y, ∥ ∥*). Conditions are determined for a series of elements in the space of functions of bounded φ-variation to have property O(X, Y). These conditions are rephrased for the case when convergence with respect to the norm ∥∥ϕv is replaced by modular convergence generated by φ-variation.
