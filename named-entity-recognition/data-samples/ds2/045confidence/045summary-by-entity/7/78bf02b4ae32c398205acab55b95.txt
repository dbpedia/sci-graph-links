Abstract This study analyzed structures of natural riparian forests and explored planning models applicable to establishing riparian greenways. Twenty-one streams or valleys were selected considering watersheds and climate regions of four major rivers in South Korea. The study surveyed mature structures and growth environments of the forests typical of the study streams in 122 sample plots. Forest communities associated with environmental gradients from floodplains to uplands were typified based on importance values of woody plant species and classification criteria of forest types in the country. The riparian forests were classified into 6â€“12 community types for each river watershed. The majority of dominant community tree species were distributed widely over the study streams, but some tree species were dominant in community types found in warmer regions only. This study presented planning models for restoring riparian greenways that reflect the distinct structural characteristics of the native community types. The planning models included species selection and composition, density and distance, and soil properties for tree plantings by community type, as well as a minimum width for riparian greenways. The models emphasized highly diverse ecological planting to enhance the multiple functions of riparian greenways, and establish native landscapes earlier through direct tree plantings rather than natural succession. A case study greenway was designed and planted to illustrate application of the planning model.
