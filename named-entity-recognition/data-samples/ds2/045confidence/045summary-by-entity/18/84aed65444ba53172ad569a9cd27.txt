Abstract  To facilitate just and sound decisions legal measurements must be reliable. The aim of this paper is to explore how this is currently achieved and how it might be better done. It considers the different types of legal proceedings, the role of chemical measurement, level of proof, the different types of chemical measurement, measurement units, the role of government, the chemical measurement industry and its control, legal metrology and the development of a measurement system based on metrological principles. It is argued that recent developments provide the basis for a robust support system, that but more needs to be done. It is also argued that the conventional approach to legal metrology has little place in chemical measurement, but that some controls are needed in some areas. In particular, a harmonised approach to international measurement standards is advocated.
