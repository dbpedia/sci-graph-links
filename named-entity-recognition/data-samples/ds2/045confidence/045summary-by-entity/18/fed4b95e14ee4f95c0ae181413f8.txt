Summary The ladder timeN and ladder heightH of a random walk {S n ,nâ‰§1} as a pair (N, H) lie in the domain of attraction of a bivariate stable law ifS 1 is in a domain of attraction, as was shown by Greenwood et al. (1982). In this paper we prove a converse. IfP(S n >0) converges and (N, H) lies in a bivariate domain of attraction thenS 1 is also in a domain of attraction.
