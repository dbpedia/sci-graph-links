Summary The Galerkin Formulation and the Hamilton-Ritz Formulation: A Comparison. It is the purpose of this paper to show why the solutions to continuous systems, whether conservative or nonconservative, stationary or nonstationary, cannot be achieved from the Galerkin formulation by means of the simple power series with the simplicity now demonstrated in our published papers. Hamilton's law and Hamilton's principle are discussed. The Galerkin formulation is applied to the differential equation. The source of the differential equation is immaterial. The result is compared to the Ritz method applied to Hamilton's law which is called the Hamilton-Ritz formulation. The result clearly demonstrates why our direct analytical solutions for continuua, except for easily identifiable special cases, have not been and cannot be obtained through a correct, direct application of the Galerkin method.
