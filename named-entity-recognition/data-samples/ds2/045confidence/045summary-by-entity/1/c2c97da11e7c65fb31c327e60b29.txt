Abstract This paper studies the strict dual of a projective algebraic curve, mainly in positive characteristic. Inclusion relations among the osculating spaces of the dual and the duals of those of the curve are obtained and shown to be optimal in several cases. As a consequence, a characterization of the non-reflexive curves that coincide with their bidual is obtained.
