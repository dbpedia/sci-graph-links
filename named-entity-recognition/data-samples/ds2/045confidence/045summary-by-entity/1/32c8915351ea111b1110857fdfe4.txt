Summary A brief review of the main points of Eringen's theory of micromorphic bodies is first given, and balance equations for the linear isotropic micropolar and microstretch body are established. By appeal to the Fourier exponential transformation, nonlocal constitutive equations are derived, and assumptions with regard to the nonlocal moduli are made. The general field equations governing the propagation of a nonlocal surface wave are particularized so as to coincide with the results obtained directly in references [12], [17], [22], and [23], respectively. As an illustrative example, propagation of a microrotation and microstretch wave in a nonlocal medium in the entire Brillouin zone is examined.
