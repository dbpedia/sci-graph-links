Summary Environmental education is essential to the success of Agenda 21. Yet currently it is without focus and effectively side-lined. This paper supplies a strategy and accompanying methodology for establishing environmental education as a major force for implementing Agenda 21. The author proposes the establishment of an Education 21 programme and the designation of the educational community as a new Rio major group. Recommendations are made to appropriate competent bodies.
