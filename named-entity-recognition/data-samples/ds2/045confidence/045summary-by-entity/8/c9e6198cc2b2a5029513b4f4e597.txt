Abstract In general, content distribution and multicasting can be implemented from proxies and gateways in the network on a static host in wired/wireless network environments. However, if an end point host moves to different wireless access networks, it will have a problem in many situations. For example, consideration of contents like the level of required service quality for network search, handoff, connection and call time, and caching and load balancing is necessary. Unlike previous studies, this article analyzes additional costs related to Fast Handover and compares the performance of group of pictures and data transmission delay time. For this, first, the total additional cost was divided into signaling cost and packet transmission cost, and results of the comparison calculated for video data transmission delay time and traffic overhead are presented. This article proposes service quality improvement methods by acquiring multiuser channel state information for multicast video-streaming transmission with a method implemented between network layers. Channel state information of each user in the multicast group is used as information for the transmission of multicast packets. Thus, through simulation like real-time traffic, the optimum traffic transmission state is maintained. As a result of the simulation, we found that video-streaming service performance for multicast users improved by applying the approach method between layers. This article proposes optimization methods of a cross-layered approach for wireless network multimedia communication systems and video-streaming application services.
