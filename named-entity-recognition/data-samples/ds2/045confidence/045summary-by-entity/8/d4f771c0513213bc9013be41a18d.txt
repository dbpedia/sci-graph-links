Abstract The Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) is a network to provide communication between nearby V2V (Vehicular to vehicular) and V2I(Vehicular to Infrastructure). In order to increase the network efficiency, it is required to have stability of transmission and security of reliability. In this paper, we propose a novel Vehicular Authentication Security Scheme (VASS) guaranteeing secure RSUs (Roadside Units) to OBUs(On-Board Units) in VANET on the basis of the ID-based authentication scheme using hi-pass card (or highway pass ticket) and license plate number. We show a usefulness and effectiveness of VASS after analyzed by the Petri nets.
