Abstract This paper presents a number of distance upper bounds for Turbo-codes designed with dithered relative prime (drp) interleavers. These bounds help determine how much dither should be applied and which input data patterns to test when designing high-distance interleavers with different lengths. Using a block length of only 640 data bits, true minimum distances of 30, 42 and 53 have been achieved for rate 1/3 Turbo-codes with 4, 8 and 16-state constituent codes, respectively. Simulated error rate results for a block length of 1504 data bits (188 bytes,mpeg packet) show excellent flare performance.
