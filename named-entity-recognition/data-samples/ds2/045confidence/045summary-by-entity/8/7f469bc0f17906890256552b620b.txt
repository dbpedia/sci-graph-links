Abstract Proxy signature has drawn great concerns. However, there still remains a challenge to construct a provably secure and efficient proxy signature scheme. In this paper, we propose an efficient proxy signature scheme based on factoring, and prove that it is secure in the random oracle. Furthermore, we present a new type of proxy signature, called Proxy Signature with Untrustworthy Proxy Signer, and construct a concrete scheme.
