Abstract Pairwise key establishment is a fundamental security service in sensor networks; it enables sensor nodes to communicate securely with each other using cryptographic techniques. In order to ensure this security, many approaches have been proposed recently. One of them is to use key predistribution schemes (KPSs) by means of combinatorial designs. In this paper, we use the Bushâ€™s construction of orthogonal arrays to present a class of key predistribution schemes for distributed sensor networks. The secure connectivity and resilience of the resulting sensor network are analyzed. This KPS constructed in our paper has some better properties than those of the existing schemes.
