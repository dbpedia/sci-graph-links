Summary The continuous expansion of diverse mobile devices with various kinds of integrated sensors, namely GPS receivers, different mobile communications technologies and the ubiquitous availability of and access to the Internet fosters the development of location-based services (LBS). Yet again trust, security and protection of the user's privacy are important for the success of such services. The proposed solution is based on cryptographic techniques, which allow the development and deployment of commercial LBS with privacy protection.
